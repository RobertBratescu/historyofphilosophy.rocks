						<ol>
							<li>Metaphysics - studies the nature of universe as a whole</li>
							<li>
								Epistemology - defines the nature and means of human knowledge
							</li>
							<li>
								*Philosophical psychology - the application of Metaphysics and
								Epistemology to philosopher's view on the nature of man
							</li>
							<li>
								Ethics - defines a code of values to guide human choices and
								actions
							</li>
							<li>
								Politics - defines the proper nature of society, and
								particularly the proper functions of government
							</li>
							<li>
								Esthetics - defines the nature and purpose of art, and the
								standards by which it is to be objectively evaluated
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>3 basic questions</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>"What is there?"(Metaphysics)</li>
							<li>"How do you know?"(Ethics)</li>
							<li>"So what?"(Ethics and Politics)</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>
							<strong>Philosophy</strong> is the subject which studies the
							nature of the universe, and of man's means of knowing the
							universe, and which on this basis provides a code of values to
							guide human actions and institutions.

						>2. Thales of Miletus and the Birth of Greek Philosophy</label

					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Thales of Miletus and the Birth of Greek Philosophy</h2>
						<p>
							Philosophy developed in Greece because Greece was an exception on
							the view of the world.
						</p>
						<h3>What made it possible?</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The Greeks had achieved a comparative degree of political
								freedom
							</li>
							<li>
								Peculiar religion - Gods were not creators of the world; not its
								rulers or directors
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							They believed in a shadowy immortality, but they didn't yearn for
							it; a pro-<i>this</i>-life attitude
						</p>

						<h3>What did they think about?</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Change & Multiplicity</strong><br />
								Change - anything that happens (occurrence, event, motion,
								activity) <br />
								Multiplicity (many) - There are many things in the world. What
								is the <i>relationship</i> between all of these different
								things?
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>The Father of Philosophy: Thales of Miletus (585 BC)</h3>
						<p>School: Miletians</p>
						<p>
							There is one <i>fundamental stuff</i> which makes up the entire
							universe: a "world stuff" (Monism)
						</p>
						<p>Everything is just many different forms of that one stuff</p>
						<p>Thales was looking for <u>the one in the many</u></p>
						<p>Thales thought that that "world stuff" was <u>water</u></p>
						<p>
							He established a naturalistic approach to the world, he introduced
							the idea that there are natural laws governing what takes place.

						Contradiction</label
					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Heraclitus of Ephesus: A World of Change and Contradiction</h2>
						<p>
							Heraclitus (500 BC) - the first enduringly influential philosopher
						</p>
						<p>"the dark" - offered oracular aphorisms without explanation</p>
						<p>All-out attack on the law of identity</p>
						<p>
							Change is incompatible with the laws of logic - change requires
							the existence of contradictions
						</p>
						<p>Something can be A and not-A at the same time</p>
						<p>Change necessarily requires contradictions</p>
						<p>Everything is Change. The "world stuff" is change itself</p>
						<p>The essence of reality is <i>change</i></p>
						<p>Everything is changing, in every respect, at every instant.</p>
						<p>
							"You can't step into the same river twice, for fresh waters are
							always flowing in"
						</p>
						<p>There are no entities</p>
						<ul>
							<li>"Nothing is; everything is becoming"</li>
							<li>"Everything flows and nothing abides"</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This is a <i>process philosophy</i> because it holds that process,
							activity, motion, change, is reality.
						</p>
						<p>Heraclitus' follower: Cratylus, also teacher of Plato</p>
						<p>
							He stopped talking on principle, on the grounds that there is no
							way to give words meaning.
						</p>
						<p>
							Epistemology: The first man to regard the senses as invalid. by
							the means of our senses, it <i>appears</i> that there are
							permanent, motionless, in changing things, which is not true, so
							senses are deceptive.
						</p>
						<p>2 realms: Reality vs Appearance</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Reality is that which really exists. Known by reason, apart from
								the senses
							</li>
							<li>Appearance is that which appears to us</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Reason as opposed to the sense = RATIONALIST</p>

					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Parmenides of Elea: Logic Demands a Changeless Universe</h2>
						<p>Parmenides (480 BC) - Eleiaticism / Eleiatic philosophy</p>
						<p>The first to support convictions with reasoned argument</p>
						<p>
							Basic principle:
							<strong
								>What is, is, and what is not, is not, and what is not can
								neither be, nor be thought about</strong
							>
						</p>
						<h3>Systematic deductions</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>The universe must be uncreated.</li>
							<li>
								The universe must be indestructible; it could never go out of
								existence. The universe is therefore eternal.
							</li>
							<li>
								Can there be such a thing as a vacuum? Absolutely not. The
								universe is a plenum (full).
							</li>
							<li>Change is impossible - change of any kind</li>
						</ol>
						<p>"Father of Logic"</p>
						<p>
							A seed growing into a flower. The seed is what is, the flower is
							what is not. The seed disappears and the flower appears. Change is
							a double violation of his principle: every change is a
							simultaneous passage from what is to what is not, ant what is not
							to what is. But there is no "what is not".
						</p>
						<p>
							Agreement with Heraclitus: Change implies a contradiction - a
							violation of logic
						</p>
						<p>Parmenides went on to deny multiplicity. It is an illusion.</p>
						<p>Epistemologically: Rationalism</p>
						<p>Parmenides' follower: Zeno (490 - 430 BC)</p>
						<p>Paradoxes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Motion is impossible <br />
								It's impossible to cross a room. You have to cross half of it,
								and half of that, etc. You can subdivide infinitely. <br />
								Applies to talking.
							</li>
							<li>
								Multiplicity is impossible <br />
								Multiplicity is the view that the world consists of a number of
								things. The world can't be a whole composed of parts. <br />
								<ul>
									<li>
										If the world is a whole with parts, what size would the
										universe be and how many parts does it have? Infinite number
										of parts because every magnitude is theoretically divisible
										without limit and if there's an infinite number of parts we
										must have an infinitely big universe
									</li>
									<li>
										What will be the size of the ultimate parts of the universe?
										There has to be such ultimate indivisible parts. But any
										magnitude is divisible. So the ultimate parts must be zero
										in size
									</li>
								</ul>

						<h2>
							Pythagoras: Mathematics and the Mysticism of the Orphan Religion
						</h2>
						<p>Pythagoras (530 BC) & the Pythagoreans</p>
						<p>Mystic sect. First religious philosophers</p>
						<p>Mystery religion - Orphic mystery religion</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Man has 2 parts. High and low. The high is the soul, the low
								part is the body. They are in eternal conflict
							</li>
							<li>The soul is akin to God but fell from grace</li>
							<li>
								As a punishment the soul was put in the body, the body is a
								prison.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Long series of reincarnations, the goal is to stop.</p>
						<p>Primary source of the soul-body opposition.</p>
						<p>
							They discovered that Mathematics was somehow everywhere. Music,
							Astronomy, Medicine
						</p>
						<p>They represented numbers by physical things.</p>
						<p>
							They confused numbers with the physical entities which they
							represent.
						</p>
						<p>
							The crucial point is the vital importance of mathematics in
							discovering the laws of the world
						</p>
						<p>
							Modern physics would have been impossible without the discovery
							that physical laws have to be formulated in mathematics.
						</p>
						<p>Numbers or numerical relations govern the behavior of things.</p>
						<h3>Metaphysical Dualism (2 realities):</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The world of number - can't be grasped by the sense, is
								immutable
							</li>
							<li>
								This world - can be grasped by the sense, constantly changing
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The MD solved the Parmenidean - Heraclitean dilemma.</p>
						<h3>To be true knowledge, something must be mathematical.</h3>
						<p>Major legacies:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Mind-body dichotomy</li>
							<li>The ultimate goal is to escape the body</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You can't commit suicide because you belong to God</p>
						<p>Ethics: Purify yourself by withdrawing from the physical</p>
						<p>3 types of men who come to the Olympic games</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The lowest - the guy who comes to make money</li>
							<li>
								The athletes - desire for something more spiritual (honor,
								glory), but still materialistic
							</li>
							<li>
								The highest, the spectators - simply want to look out and see
								what's happening, want to acquire knowledge in a disinterested
								way
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Supreme importance of knowledge so long as it is disinterested -
							severing knowledge from life, knowledge is an end in itself.

						>6. The Pluralists, the Atomists and the Birth of Determinism</label
					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>The Pluralists, the Atomists and the Birth of Determinism</h2>
						<p>
							3 kinds of philosophy formulated in Greece that endure to this day
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Materialism - metaphysics - reality is matter in motion, mental
								phenomenon are to be explained entirely in physical, material
								terms(implied by Thales)
							</li>
							<li>
								Skepticism - no objective knowledge of anything is possible.
								What we call "knowledge" is really a guess, hunch, subjective
								feeling, a probability, but not true knowledge (derivative of
								Heraclitus)
							</li>
							<li>
								Idealism - metaphysics - reality is basically non-material; the
								material world is simply a byproduct or expression of something
								non-material in character (derivative of Pythagoreans)
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>The Atomists</h3>
						<p>
							The outcome of a different attempt to reconcile Parmenides and
							Heraclitus - Pluralists
						</p>
						<p>
							Abandoned Monism (the view that there is only one "world stuff").
							There are many different stuffs which make up the world
						</p>
						<p>
							Locomotion is the only type of change permitted. It is simply a
							rearrangement of the stuffs that always exist.
						</p>
						<h4>Empedocles (490 - 435 BC)</h4>
						<p>There were 4 stuffs - earth, air, water & fire</p>
						<h4>Anaxagoras (500 BC)</h4>
						<p>
							If there are no new qualities, there has to be more than 4 stuffs.
							Banana stuff, hair stuff, etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							Little tiny bits of all these stuffs are in everything ("seeds"),
							then change would really be a rearrangement.
						</p>
						<h3>Leucippus (6th BC) & Democritus (460 - 360 BC)</h3>
						<p>2 kinds of characteristics</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Qualities - colors, sounds, odors, etc.</li>
							<li>Quantities - size, shape, motion/ rest, number</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Strip qualities from the things altogether. No qualities are real.
							What we call qualities are the subjective effects on human beings.
						</p>
						<p>
							Reality consists of little, tiny Parmenidean One solidly packed
							and therefore uncuttable
						</p>
						<p>Atoms - from "atome", meaning uncuttable</p>
						<p>There must be empty space between atoms.</p>
						<p>Reality consists of</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Atoms</li>
							<li>The void</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Nothing ever happens by chance, nothing ever happens for a
							purpose, end or goal - Mechanistic Materialism
						</p>
						<h3>
							Mechanism - everything happens according to the laws of mechanics;
							contrasted with teleology - the idea that purpose is operative
							somewhere in the universe
						</h3>
						<p>Man is governed by rigid Determinism</p>
						<p>
							The soul is made of soul atoms - they are completely physical and
							they are diffused throughout the world.
						</p>
						<p>Consciousness is a quivering of the soul atoms</p>
						<p>Epistemology: You cannot rely on your senses</p>
						<p>
							Convention: anything which is a product of man's subjective
							constitution, as against the actual facts of reality.
						</p>
						<p>They are philosophical rationalists.</p>
						<p>
							Mechanistic materialism as a metaphysics is completely invalid,
							because it denies the existence of mind, and as such, it's
							self-refuting
						</p>
						<h4>
							Reductive materialism - everything is the material - love is
							hormones
						</h4>
						<h4>
							Epiphenomenalism - everything is a helpless cause of physical
							events - love is provoked by the hormones
						</h4>

						>7. The Skepticism of the Greek Sophists</label

					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>The Skepticism of the Greek Sophists</h2>
						<p>Sophists were a professional class in the 5th BC</p>
						<p>How to win friends, gain political power.</p>
						<p>
							They received money from teaching philosophy - regarded immoral
						</p>
						<h3>Protagoras (480 - 410 BC) and Gorgias (483 - 375 BC)</h3>
						<p>The sophists were the first avowed skeptics in history.</p>
						<p>All out attack on the senses.</p>
						<p>Whenever we perceive, what we perceive depends upon 2 factors</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The object being perceived</li>
							<li>
								The nature and condition of your sensory apparatus (ex.
								daltonism, size of the sun and distance)
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Nobody is right because nobody cand perceive reality except as
							processed by his particular sensory. All you can really know is
							what appears to you.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is no "it is", only "it appears to me". Each of us lives in
							our own subjective world.
						</p>
						<p>2 truths:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Perception is impossible without sensory organs</li>
							<li>
								The type of organs that you have affects the type of experience
								you have
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Protagoras: You can never perceive reality</p>
						<p>
							Reason depends on the evidence of the senses, but since the sense
							show us our own subjective world ("true for me").
						</p>
						<p>
							The argument from disagreement: Everybody disagrees about what is
							rational; who is to sau what's really true?
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything is constantly changing so nothing is an absolute ("it
							seems to be <strong>now</strong>")
						</p>
						<p>
							Protagoras: Man is the measure of all things, of things that are,
							that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not.
						</p>
						<p>
							Cycle of philosophy: A constructive era collapses into total
							skepticism, and then the beginning of a new one, collapsing into a
							still deeper skepticism
						</p>
						<p>Sophists are agnostics</p>
						<p>
							There is no objective ethics. Complete ethical subjectivists and
							complete ethical relativists. Virtue is an arbitrary social
							convention.
						</p>
						<p>Resolve conflicts through brute physical force</p>
						<p>Egoism - do not sacrifice for others</p>

						>8. The Life and teachings of Socrates</label
					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>The Life and teachings of Socrates</h2>
						<p>
							Socrates and Plato set out to answer the Sophists - to ground
							objective knowledge and objective morality
						</p>
						<p>They founded the first complete philosophy</p>
						<h3>Socrates (470 - 400 BC)</h3>
						<p>
							Socrates left no writings; he is known primarily through Plato’s
							dialogues.
						</p>
						<p>Socrates' interest was in ethics.</p>
						<h3>Socrates' Method</h3>
						<p>"The unexamined life is not worth living"</p>
						<p>
							He was arrested - charged with corrupting the youth and
							worshipping false gods. The court voted for death by hemlock.
						</p>
						<p>First Philosophic martyr</p>
						<p>His story is contained in 3 dialogues of Plato:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Apology - trial</li>
							<li>Crito - time in prison</li>
							<li>Phaedo - last hours of Socrates</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Father of Definitions</h4>
						<p>
							How to define - statement of the characteristics that are common
							to some class - those characteristics possessed by every member of
							the class, in virtue of which they're members of that class
						</p>
						<p>
							You concentrate when you want a definition not on
							<i>particulars</i>, but on <i>universals</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							The crucial problem of human knowledge was the knowledge of
							universals.
						</p>
						<p>Wherever we have a word, we have a universal</p>
						<p>
							Man is distinctive through his ability to distinguish universals
						</p>
						<p>Importance of conceptual, as distinct from the perceptual</p>

						<h2>
							Plato's Metaphysics: The Perceptible World and the World of Ideal
							Forms
						</h2>
						<h3>Plato (427 - 347 BC)</h3>
						<p>
							Founded the first university of the Western World- The Academy
						</p>
						<p>One of 2 most influential philosophers of all time</p>
						<p>
							He is the first great philosophic genius in human history in 3
							ways:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>his abstract ability</li>
							<li>his originality</li>
							<li>his power of systematic integration</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Metaphysics</h3>
						<p>
							Agreed with Socrates - knowledge was the knowledge of universals
						</p>
						<p>Premise: universals must be knowable -> then, they must exist</p>
						<p>Where/ How do they exist? - <i>the problem of universals</i></p>
						<p>
							Universals and particulars have radically different
							characteristics -> radically different <i>kinds</i> of things
						</p>
						<p>
							Two world: one with characteristics of universals, one with
							characteristics of particulars
						</p>
						<h4>
							Argument 1: The Argument from the Differences between Universals
							and Particulars
						</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>There is one universal per category, but many particulars</li>
							<li>Particulars change, universals go on unchanging</li>
							<li>
								Particulars are primarily material; universals are abstract,
								nonphysical
							</li>
							<li>
								Particulars are known by means of the senses; universals are
								known by reason, intellect
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h4>Argument 2: The Argument of Perfection</h4>
						<p>Where do we get our concepts and standards of perfection</p>
						<p>There is no such thing as a perfection in <i>this</i> world</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Things in this world change. If a thing changes, it couldn't be
								perfect, it would simply stand still, it would lack nothing
							</li>
							<li>
								Even in mathematics, the Platonists say, you'll never find
								perfection (perfect triangle, perfect line).
							</li>
							<li>
								We criticize things as imperfect; this presupposes that we know
								what perfection would consist of - and we couldn't have got it
								from this world
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							When we think of a universal, we usually have a perfect,
							unblemished representative in mind. The world of perfection is
							precisely the world of universals.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Innate ideas - i.e., knowledge possessed in us at birth.</li>
							<li>
								The soul must be independent of the body - the groundwork to
								establish the immortality of the soul
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h4>Argument 3: The Argument from the Order of Knowledge</h4>
						<p>
							Which, in logic, would you have to learn first: universals or
							particulars?
						</p>
						<p>
							Plato says it's impossible to know particulars. It is impossible
							to collect particular instances of justice and then abstract from
							them the concept of "justice". You must know beforehand what
							justice looks like.
						</p>
						<p>
							There must be a realm of universals independent of this world
							which we knew before this life. We were born with all this
							knowledge, it's unconscious and we have to <i>unearth</i> it
						</p>
						<h4>Argument 4: The Argument from the Possibility of Knowledge</h4>
						<ol>
							<il
								>You can't know a world of flux, but this world is a world of
								flux. If reality is to be knowable, it must be immutable - that
								means another world.</il
							>
							<li>
								If a world is changing, it's contradictory, and you can't know
								the contradictory. If a world is to be knowable, it must be made
								of consistent entities, entities which don't change.
							</li>
							<li>
								Knowledge acquired by the senses is invalid. Knowledges of
								reality must be acquired by <i>non-sensory</i> means; and thus
								it must be of a <i>non-material</i> object.
							</li>
							<li>
								The crucial thing to know is universals, and universals have all
								the characteristics that the world that's knowable has to have -
								they're immutable, self-consistent, motionless, non-material
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h5>
							Conclusion: if there's to be knowledge of reality at all, it must
							be of a world of universals, and not of this world.
						</h5>
						<p>
							True knowledge is knowledge of the other world - the world of
							universals, which includes numbers and everything else that has
							instances, actual or possible
						</p>
						<p>
							The world of universals - also called the world of Essences,
							Forms, Ideas, or the Intelligible World
						</p>
						<p>
							The world of particulars - or the physical world, or the sensible
							world - the world you grasp by the senses
						</p>
						<h4>Differences:</h4>
						<p>
							Universals are independent of the particulars in this world, and
							they are independent of our thoughts.
							<strong
								>Universals are actual entities, things, real, external objects,
								but not physical</strong
							>. For every class of particulars, there is a corresponding
							universal. Particulars are not really knowable. true knowledge is
							always knowledge of the forms.
						</p>
						<p>Of the 2 worlds, Plato regarded the world of Forms as real.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Test 1: To be real, a thing has to exist. It can't be
								contradictory. But, to be non-contradictory, it has to be
								motionless, because change involves a contradiction. The things
								in this world are contradictory.
							</li>
							<li>
								Test 2: A thing is real when it's knowable. If knowledge is of
								reality, and knowledge is only of the world of Forms, then the
								world of Forms is reality, not this world.
							</li>
							<li>Test 3: The real is the perfect - the ideal</li>
							<li>
								Test 4: The real is the original, as against imitations. The
								World of Forms is original, the res is imitation.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>What is the status of <i>this</i> world in which we live?</p>
						<p>
							It's like a byproduct, derivative, projection, or reflection of
							true reality. (in a fun house mirror show, you are the world of
							forms and the distortions in the mirrors are this world)
						</p>
						<h4>
							This world is the world of Forms reflected, or projected, into a
							medium
						</h4>
						<p>
							Space is the medium which enables the Forms to take on physical
							location.
						</p>
						<h4>
							Plato did not believe this world was created <i>ex nihilo</i> (out
							of nothing).
						</h4>
						<h3>The myth of the Demiurge</h3>
						<p>
							The Demiurge is a sort of godlike, but very limited, soul that
							wanders freely in the universe.
						</p>
						<p>
							With one eye on the perfection of the world of Forms, he shaped
							and organized the matter like an architect to produce as much
							order, harmony, symmetry, perfection as he could.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is the most primitive form of the
							<i>Argument from Design</i> for the existence of God.
						</p>
						<p>The Demiurge left an imperfection: nothing</p>
						<h4>
							The Form of the Good - the ultimate Form in the world of Forms
						</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Metaphysically, it is the <i>purpose</i> of all existence and
								the <i>source</i> of existence.
							</li>
							<li>
								Epistemologically, it is the source of all intelligibility -
								it's what makes anything understandable
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Plato believed that the Form of the Good is <i>ineffable</i>. To
							grasp it, you must have a vision which is self-illuminating.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is <i>mysticism</i> - the view that knowledge is obtainable
							by means other than reason or senses.
						</p>
						<h3>To sum up Plato's metaphysics:</h3>
						<p>
							There is a world of Forms, presided over by the Form of the Good,
							all of it reflected into space, thereby generating this half-real
							reflection that we call the physical world.

							Plato's Epistemology: Deduction, Recollection and Mystical Insight
						</h2>
						<p>
							One main purpose of Plato's Philosophy was to answer the Sophists
							- to show that objective knowledge is possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							we must have been in contact with the world of Forms
							<i>prior</i> to this life
						</p>
						<p>
							But, when it was immersed in the body, the soul forgot all the
							things that it knew - but it's still there.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Acquiring" knowledge is actually remembrance (anamnesis), getting
							knowledge from the subconscious to the conscious.
						</p>
						<p>
							The senses are not a means of getting <i>new</i> knowledge. We
							need senses in the early stages of knowledge to serve as a
							stimulus.
						</p>
						<h4>The general arguments for innate ideas:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								We have a certain type of knowledge that we could
								<i>not</i> have acquired from sensory observation
							</li>
							<li>But we have it</li>
							<li>
								Therefore, it must have been acquired afrom some means apart
								from the senses
							</li>
							<li>We must be born with it - it must be innate</li>

					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Plato’s Ethics: Virtue and the Health of the Soul</h2>
						<h3>Socrates' ethics</h3>
						<p>
							Soul for Socrates - the psychological or spiritual element in man.
						</p>
						<p>Virtue = excellent performance of function</p>
						<p>Pleasure is not happiness (eudaimonia)</p>
						<p>
							<i>No man can really be harmed by anybody else</i> because the
							crucial determinant of his soul is up to him; nobody can make you
							unhappy in this fundamental sense. Conversely, they can also not
							<i>give</i> you happiness.
						</p>
						<p>Virtue requires knowledge</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Knowledge is a <i>necessary</i> condition of virtue.</li>
							<li>
								Knowledge is a sufficient condition of virtue - How does virtue
								guarantees virtue? Everyone necessarily pursues that which je
								thinks will lead to his own welfare. Everyone who knows what
								virtue is and sees that it leads to his welfare will necessarily
								pursue it. Therefore, everyone who doesn't live the good lige
								does not know the nature and the rewards of virtue.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							The second has a negative effect: It wipes out the distinction
							between errors of knowledge and breaches of morality. There is no
							volitional immoral behavior.
						</p>
						<p>
							It assumes that all men are rational egoists, which is
							demonstrably false. To become a rational egoist is an achievement,
							not an innate endowment.
						</p>
						<h4>
							Essential to free will is that you have to summon your knowledge
							and concentrate on it in any given situation by consistent acts of
							focusing.
						</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Man has a nature</li>
							<li>
								happiness depends on living in accordance with your nature
							</li>
							<li>
								Sophistic whim-worshipping is the means to guaranteed misery
							</li>
							<li>
								Knowledge of man's nature and requirements is indispensable to
								virtue and happiness.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>
							Plato's psychology (the nature of the soul and the nature of man)
						</h3>
						<p>Man is a creature who has ties to <i>both</i> worlds.</p>
						<p>
							Man's higher nature is his reason, his mind, the part that studies
							the Forms and acquires knowledge
						</p>
						<p>
							His lower nature is the irrational element in him - feelings and
							emotions for things in this world.
						</p>
						<p>
							These 2 are fundamentally <i>independent</i> and
							<i>opposed</i> components making up the essence of the soul
						</p>
						<h4>The Argument from conflict</h4>
						<p>
							If a man is urged in 2 opposite directions at the same time, there
							must be two opposite parts at work, 2 independent motivating
							sources, one pushing one way, and one the other.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The lowest part he calls the <i>appetites</i> - the desires for
								physical things
							</li>
							<li>
								The higher part of the lower part, the <i>spirited</i> element -
								passionate, more violent part of your emotional life
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Inside the skin of every man there are 3 creatures: little
							man(reason), lion (the spirited element), and a many-headed,
							slobbering beast (the appetites)
						</p>
						<h4>
							For Plato there is a tripartite soul - 3 autonomous sources of
							behavior, so that man is inherently in conflict
						</h4>
						<p>
							The Greeks’ 4 cardinal virtues: wisdom, courage, temperance and
							justice.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The spirited element is the part that incites you to action. Its
								proper function is to let itself be guided by reason. If so, man
								will have the virtue of courage.
							</li>
							<li>
								The appetitive lament performs the life-promoting functions -
								concern for food, sex, sustenance, physical goods. This is the
								most dangerous lament - we must never indulge in appetites as
								ends in themselves. If you do this, you have temperance.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							If all parts work well and do not interfere with another, then the
							man has justice.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you live the way the Sophists say you will kill yourself
							spiritually.
						</p>
						<h3>Platonic views:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>
								A certain type of determinism. You are helpless to change your
								character.
							</li>
							<li>
								Since the passions in general are bad, and all men necessarily
								feel them, there is an Achille’s heel in human nature, and the
								ground is prepared for the Original Sin.
							</li>
							<li>
								Emotions are basical antithetical to reason, and they demand
								some expression, and therefore a completely rational man would
								have to be a man without emotions.
							</li>
							<li>
								The grading of careers depending upon which part of the soul is
								most involved. Businessmen, industrialists, producers come out
								as very low types, as against philosophers, or "pure"
								scientists.
							</li>
							<li>The idea that the love of money is the root of all evil.</li>
							<li>
								The Platonic view of sex. How should true love operate? An
								individual's body, then soul, then the beauty of both, then the
								beauty of art, scientific discoveries, laws, etc., adn then you
								love the Form of beauty. Platonic love is the Form of Beauty/
								Form of the Good

						<h3>Plato's Politics</h3>
						<h4>Three Classes of Men</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>
								men in whom <i>reason</i> is dominant: <i>Philosophers</i>
							</li>
							<li>
								Men in whom the <i>spirited</i> element is dominant:
								<i>Soldiers</i>
							</li>
							<li>
								Men in whom the <i>appetites</i> are most developed:
								<i>the Masses</i>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h4>The Myth of the Metals</h4>
						<p>
							Philosophers have gold in their souls, the soldiers have silver,
							the masses ave brass. Innately determined by the kind of spiritual
							metal they have in their soul.
						</p>
						<h4>Who should rule?</h4>
						<p>
							The Philosophers - they are the only men of reason, the only ones
							who know the Form of the Good, who know what's right and how to
							act.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just as reason has to rule in the soul, so the men of reason have
							to rule in the state. Just as reason must have unlimited power in
							the soul, philosophers must have unlimited power in the state.
						</p>
						<h4>
							Why not let each man rule his <i>own</i> life by his own reason?
						</h4>
						<p>
							Because it is impossible for most men to live their own lives
							rationally. They are in the cave.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>This world is unreal; true knowledge is otherworldly.</li>
							<li>
								Most men are this worldly - they're incapable of a mystic
								vision.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Most men are incurably irrational, incapable to rule themselves.
							Therefore, we need rule by an authoritarian few who have
							specialized knowledge.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mysticism leads to dictatorship. Irrationalism leads to statism.
						</p>
						<h4>Three-class society</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>
								The philosophers: the state has the virtue of <i>wisdom</i> when
								they are in charge - legislature
							</li>
							<li>
								The Military: when they have properly performed their functions,
								the state has <i>courage</i> - executive
							</li>
							<li>
								The Masses: their primary virtue is <i>temperance</i>, which in
								this context means obedience - economic class
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>This is not a caste society.</p>
						<h4>Will Philosophers abuse their power?</h4>
						<p>
							They know the good, they have lost interest in everything that
							could tempt them - remove all their property to make sure
						</p>
						<p>
							Individuality is not real. All that is real are universals. What
							is real about men is what the thing they are all the same in -
							meanness
						</p>
						<h4>What is your political obligation according to Plato?</h4>
						<p>
							Live for the welfare of the state, recognize your position in
							society.
						</p>
						<p>
							Education must be thoroughly controlled by the state, we must have
							thorough censorship.

					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Aristotle: A Philosopher for Living on Earth</h2>
						<p>
							Aristotelianism is philosophy as a rational science versus
							philosophy as a rationalization for subjective whims or mystic
							trances.
						</p>
						<h3>Aristotle (384 - 322 BC)</h3>
						<p>He studied under Plato for ~20 years. He was a Platonist.</p>
						<p>
							He came to question and reject Plato's views, developing his own
							philosophy.
						</p>
						<p>He opened The Lyceum, his own university.</p>
						<p><strong>"The peripatetic philosopher"</strong></p>
						<h3>Metaphysics</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								There is one reality, <i>this reality</i> - the world we live in
							</li>
							<li>
								Reality is objective, it's absolute, it is what it is
								independent of Consciousness
							</li>
							<li>There is only this reality and no supernatural world.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>He wrote polemics against the world of Forms</p>
						<p>
							We can separate the common characteristics running through a group
							of particulars as a <i>mental</i> process, as a process of
							<i>thought</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							This does not mean that this common denominator can exist in
							reality <i>apart</i> from its particular accompaniments. It is
							simply an abstraction - a result of selective awareness on our
							part.
						</p>
						<p>
							Plato believed that because we can separate 2 things in thought,
							they can exist separately in reality.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is, says Aristotle, the fallacy of reification
							("think-making"); he makes a thing out of what is simply an
							abstraction.
						</p>
						<h4>
							Only particular, individual, concrete things exist in reality.
						</h4>
						<p>
							Universals are distinguishable from particulars, universals are
							real.
						</p>
						<h4>Universals are real, but they exist only in particulars.</h4>
						<p>
							Each thing that exists is a metaphysical compound comprised of 2
							elements:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Everything is an individual, particular concretely it is what
								Aristotle calls a "this"; it has something unique about it.
							</li>
							<li>
								It has a certain <i>nature</i>; certain characteristics it
								shares with other things on the basis of which we can classify
								it; it is not only a "this", it is a "such", a certain
								<i>kind</i> of thing
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Everything is a "this-such", a particular of a certain kind, an
							individual which belongs to a certain class.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the universal element, he uses the word "form". For the
							particular, individuating element, he use the term "matter".
						</p>
						<p>
							"Matter" stands for those aspects of a thing which make it unique;
							"form", those aspects of a thing it share with other things.
						</p>
						<h4>
							You never can have matter without form, nor matter without form.
						</h4>
						<p>
							Aristotle's view is called "Aristotelian realism" -
							<i>Universals</i> are real, but they only exist in
							<i>particulars</i>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The fundamental constituent of reality is the entity - the
							individual thing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle is the true author of the principle of the
							<i>primacy of existence</i>, as against the principle of the
							<i>primacy of consciousness</i>.
						</p>
						<h4>Primacy of existence</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Reality is what it is independent of the content or actions of
								any consciousness
							</li>
							<li>
								reality is the irreducible primary which sets the terms for
								consciousness
							</li>
							<li>
								Consciousness is simply the faculty for perceiving the facts of
								reality
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Primacy of consciousness:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Consciousness in some form comes first it sets the terms for
								reality, and reality is somehow an offshoot or derivative or
								byproduct of the activities or content of consciousness.
							</li>
							<li>
								facts are not what they are, but rather whatever the ruling
								consciousness chooses them to be
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The question is "What as a matter of fact IS reality?", then "What
							processes of knowledge are suitable for acquiring knowledge of
							such a reality?".
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle was the first who first discovered the primacy of
							reality.
						</p>
						<p>
							He refuses to endorse any dichotomy between reality and
							appearance. reality is what we observe, and any theories which go
							counter to it are simply wrong.
						</p>
						<p>Logic = "organon", metaphysics = "first philosophy"</p>

						<h2>
							Aristotle’s Epistemology: Concepts, Explanation and the Nature of
							Science
						</h2>
						<h3>
							What do we begin with in terms of knowledge? Aristotle: Nothing
						</h3>
						<p>We are born <i>tabula rasa</i></p>
						<p>All knowledge starts with sense experience.</p>
						<p>
							This view is called <i>empiricism</i> - all knowledge is derived
							from the evidence of the sense. Since Hume, empiricism =
							subjectivism/skepticism (knowledge comes ONLY by the senses)
						</p>
						<p>
							The senses are the beginning of knowledge. Concepts can be grasped
							by a process of abstraction from particulars without antecedent
							knowledge.
						</p>
						<p>The process:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>You start with sense experience.</li>
							<li>
								You remember past sense experiences - i.e., you retain your
								percepts
							</li>
							<li>
								After a number of similar percepts are repeated, you can detect
								common denominators among them and abstract, and concentrate
								selectively on the common denominators, ignoring the
								differences.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							On Plato's Argument of Perfection: Abstract away from the
							imperfection.
						</p>
						<p>
							The goal of knowledge is to understand, to find out why things
							happen - to see their <i>necessity</i>. To get to the
							<i>that</i> and the <i>why</i>, the facts and the causes.
						</p>
						<p>
							What a thing basically and essentially <i>is</i> determines its
							characteristics and its behavior. And to explain any particular
							thing, therefore, we must know to what <i>class</i> does it
							belong; what are its <i>essential characteristics</i>?
						</p>
						<h4>
							Aristotle's definition of a "definition" is "the statement of a
							class" - i.e., the statement of those fundamental characteristics
							which make the class what it is and differentiate it from all
							other types of thing. How do you arrive at correct definitions?
						</h4>
						<p>
							All definitions must have a certain structure; they consist of 2
							parts:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								The general kind of thing something is - the wider, general
								class - known as the <i>genus</i>
							</li>
							<li>
								A further element specifying how the thing differs from
								everything else within the genus - called the <i>differentia</i>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							If you have these 2 and you have chosen them correctly, you must
							have reached the essence of the class.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rule 1: Your definition must be commensurate with the class you
							are defining - i.e., it must be true only of members of the class
							and of <i>all</i> of those members. You can go wrong it 2 ways on
							this rule: either your definition might be too <i>wide</i> or too
							<i>narrow</i>, take in too much territory or not enough.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rule 2: The definition must state the
							<i>fundamental</i> characteristics of the class to be defined
						</p>
						<p>
							We must make a firm distinction between the <i>essence</i> and the
							<i>derivative</i> characteristics (Aristotle called them
							"properties"), they are not fundamental, they are results or
							effects of the essence of the class.
						</p>
						<p>
							What we do when we try to understand a fact is learn the
							connection between the essence of things and their properties.
						</p>
						<h4>
							Aristotle's theory of explanation:
							<i
								>Explanation consists in seeing the particular events that we
								observe as instances of a general principle which relates the
								nature of some class to its mode of action.</i
							>
						</h4>
						<p>
							You don't observe general principles; all we observe is
							particulars. There must be a process of acquiring the knowledge of
							the general principle by observing the particular facts, and this
							process he calls <i>induction</i>(epagoge) - "the process of
							passing in thought from particulars to a general principle"
						</p>
						<p>
							Induction is a fundamental procedure of human knowledge, because
							it is the ultimate <i>source</i> of all of our general principles.
						</p>
						<p>
							He had a primitive concept of induction - induction by
							enumeration. He had no control experimentation.
						</p>
						<p>
							The best you could get by induction was the <i>suggestion</i> of a
							law, which you then had to validate by some other means.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now we can now apply the laws we've learned to new particulars.
						</p>
						<p>
							The process of starting with the general principle and applying it
							to a particular case is, of course,
							<strong><i>deduction</i></strong
							>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Induction gives you the basic general laws; deduction uses these
							laws to explain and understand particular instances.

								<li>All men are mortal</li>

							<i>Aristotle formalized & systematized the rules of reasoning</i>

						</p>
						<p>
							There must be basic self-evident truths (archai). These are the

						<p>
							"To demand a proof of everything argues want of education" -
							Aristotle
						</p>
						<p>Aristotle distinguishes 2 general types of axioms</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Those at the base of just one science or one branch of knowledge
							</li>
							<li>
								Universal axioms - axioms which you have to know to know
								anything (e.g. laws of logic)
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Each science has special axioms unique to it. The ultimate goal is
							to find these first principles.

						<ul>
							<li>
								The basic definitions are abstracted ultimately from sense
								experience and must be objectively defined; there is no mystical
								Goodness at the end.
							</li>
							<li>
								There is no <i>one</i> ultimate principle from which every
								subject is deducible
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This is how Aristotle carved out the idea of a
							<i>specific</i> science.
						</p>
						<h3>The laws of logic</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The <i>law of contradiction</i> - nothing can be A and non-A at
								the same time and the same respect
							</li>
							<li>
								The <i>law of excluded middle</i> - nothing can be A or non-A ar
								a given time and in a given respect
							</li>
							<li>The law of identity - A is A</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The laws of logic are laws of all reality - they are laws of being
							<strong><i>qua</i></strong> being
						</p>
						<p>
							The only way we can arrive at them is by direct abstraction from
							self-evident sensory facts.
						</p>
						<p>
							The faculty which grasps the self-evident is given the forbidding
							and misleading name "intuitive <i>nous</i>". <i>Nous</i> is the
							Greek word for "mind"
						</p>
						<p>
							"Intuitive nous" simply means the human mind in its capacity to
							grasp self-evident principles, as opposed to the deductive or
							reasoning nous which draws conclusions from these principles
						</p>
						<h4>
							If the laws of logic are truly the foundation of all human
							thought, then we should be able to demonstrate that even the
							<i>objector</i> has to rely upon them - "reaffirmation through
							denial"
						</h4>
						<p>
							Aristotle was the first to give a formal definition of "truth"
							that is valid
						</p>
						<p>
							"To say of that which is, that it is, or of that which is not that
							it is not, is true. To say of that which is that it is not, or of
							that which is not that it is, is false."
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle was the first to organize and fine, in a systematic way,
							a great many common and widespread fallacies of reasoning.

					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Aristotle’s Metaphysics: Matter, Form and Causality</h2>
						<h3>Metaphysics: Universals and Particulars</h3>
						<p>
							There are 2 elements comprising each thing - a particularizing or
							individuating element, that which makes it a "this" (Aristotle
							called this "matter"), and the common or universalizing element
							(which he called "form") - two aspects which are separable in
							thought but not in reality.
						</p>
						<p>
							In general, everything is made of some stuff, and that material is
							organized, structured, formed in some particular way.
						</p>
						<p>
							The <i>form</i> (now synonymous with the structure) is what gives
							the thing its character; the <i>material</i> or <i>stuff</i> is
							what's unique to it, what makes it <i>this</i> particular instance
							of its class.
						</p>
						<h5>
							What's universal comes from structure; particularity from stuff,
							and so form and matter come now to mean structure-stuff
						</h5>
						<p>
							<strong
								>To this day, Aristotelian logic is called <i>formal</i> logic
								because Aristotle's discovery was that the validity of your
								reasoning depends exclusively upon the form, upon the
								structure.</strong
							>
						</p>
						<p>Matter:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Physical stuff</li>
							<li>The stuff of a novel</li>
							<li>The stuff of a word</li>
							<li>The stuff of a person's character</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Everything is a particular, of a certain kind</li>
								<li>Everything is matter, of a certain form</li>
								<li>
									Everything is comprised, structured or organized or formed in
									a certain manner
								</li>
							</ul>
						</h4>
						<h3>The problem of Change - solved by Aristotle</h3>
						<p>
							It's the same and it's not the same, but in 2
							<i>different</i> ways. The matter has taken the new form; the
							matter is now different <i>in respect of its organization</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							There's no change - the material has always existed, it merely
							changed it form. Change does not involve a contradiction.
						</p>
						<h4>
							Change is the process of matter taking on new form. We can start
							to speak of a thing as being matter
							<i>relative to a later state of development</i>
						</h4>
						<p>
							Bricks, we can say, are matter for a house, but it's clearer to
							say bricks are <i>potentially</i> a house. And the house, when it
							comes, is the <i>actuality</i> of the bricks, the actualization of
							their potentiality - the thing which contains, in full reality,
							what had earlier existed only potentially.
						</p>
						<p>
							Matter is any material which has potentialities for
							reorganization, any material which can become or do something. And
							form is any structure in which these potentialities are
							actualized.
						</p>
						<p>
							Any matter can be the actuality for previous matter and the
							potentiality of future actualities. (Sense data -> Concept)
						</p>
						<p>
							It is the metaphysical foundation for the view that reality is
							lawful and orderly, because what a thing is matter
							<i>for</i> depends on its nature, on what it is <i>actually</i>.
						</p>
						<p>It is not true that anything is possible.</p>
						<p>It is not true that anything could happen.</p>
						<p>
							What a thing can do (its potentialities) depends on and derives
							from what it is (its actualities).
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Actualities determine potentialities</i> - a fundamental law of
							Aristotelian metaphysics.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is the basis for a formal proof of the law of cause and
							effect.
						</p>
						<p>
							Combined with the law of identity:
							<strong
								><i
									>A thing in a given set of circumstances can act only in one
									way, the way dictated by its nature</i
								>
								- in other words, same cause, same effect.</strong
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							How many factors are there in any change, if we're to understand
							it fully?
						</p>
						<p>
							Four factors/causes (any answer to the question "Why?") of change
						</p>
						<p>
							Suppose that a man starts with some clay and molded it into a
							statue of Aristotle - can we isolate the four factors?
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The clay we started with - the material factor/cause</li>
							<li>The statue at the end - the formal cause</li>
							<li>
								The molding actions of the sculptor are what Aristotle calls the
								efficient cause - i.e., the source of the motion which brings it
								about
							</li>
							<li>The sculptor's purpose, end or goal - the final cause</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>
							Aristotle’s Teleology: Motion, Goal-Directed Action and the
							Unmoved Mover
						</h2>
						<p>Reality is this world</p>
						<h4>
							Unconscious, biological change or non-biological, mechanical
							change
						</h4>
						<p>
							The first 3 causes apply here as well (material, formal,
							efficient).
						</p>
						<p>The last one also applies, according to Aristotle.</p>
						<p>
							It seemed to him that living things aim at an end, a goal that
							they strive for, and their goal is to develop, to grow, to reach
							their full form or actuality.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle is a universal teleologist - he believes that everything
							that exists , every change has a cause.
						</p>
						<h4>Objections</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>
								It's very difficult to know what exactly it would mean to talk
								of an "unconscious goal-directed action"
							</li>
							<li>
								Many people have argued that you can give an alternative
								explanation of the apparent purposiveness of biological
								phenomena
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Aristotle's teleology is known as "immanent" - striving to reach
							its own fulfillment/ "metaphysics of self-realization"
						</p>
						<h3>Motion and the Prime Mover</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>What is the cause of motion?</strong> "motion" is any
							change/happening
						</p>
						<p>There's <i>always</i> been motion; motion is eternal.</p>
						<p>
							The cause of motion is not something which starts motion at a
							particular point in time it's the eternal factor which underlies
							all motions and explains why there is such a phenomenon as motion.
						</p>
						<p>Let's call this "the Mover".</p>
						<ul>
							<li>It is eternal</li>
							<li>
								It must be unmoved and even immovable - if it moves, then what
								moved it?
							</li>
							<li>
								It has no potentialities at all; it must be pure actuality, pure
								form (not Platonic)
							</li>
							<li>It cannot be material or physical</li>
							<li>It must be perfect</li>
						</ul>
						<p>What is the nature of the Prime Mover?</p>
						<p>
							We must think of it as a mind. Minds think. But this must be a
							very special kind of thought process, because no motion is
							allowed.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Prime Mover thinks, or is conscious, only of Himself. He
							describes it as "thought thinking about itself". This eternal,
							immutable, perfect, self-absorbed mind responsible for the motion
							of the universe Aristotle calls <i>theos</i>, "God"
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>This God did not create the universe</li>
							<li>You couldn't pray to this God</li>
							<li>This God couldn't perform miracles</li>
							<li>
								He has no plan. He does not even know that the world exists
							</li>
							<li>He has neither knowledge nor power</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							No matter how much we keep dividing a line we will end up with an
							actual number of parts. There is no such thing as an actual
							infinite, and therefore Zeno's paradox does not stand.

					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>
							Aristotle’s Psychology: The Nature of the Soul, Sense Perception
							and Thought
						</h2>
						<p>
							Aristotle wants to give a this-worldly account of the nature of
							the souls - <i>psuche</i> in Greek
						</p>
						<p>
							Soul for Aristotle is that which makes a living thing, living.
						</p>
						<p>What makes a thing the kind of thing it is? Its <i>form</i></p>
						<p>
							Soul is the <i>form</i> of the living thing the body is the
							<i>matter</i> of a living thing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle defines soul as "the actuality of a natural body having
							life potentially in it." So soul is to body, as form is to matter,
							as actuality is to potentiality.
						</p>
						<p>
							The form of a living body is a specific set of biologic powers or
							capacities - power of nutrition, of growth, of reproduction. When
							an entity has these powers, it is alive.
						</p>
						<p>Consequences:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>There can be no soul without a body</li>
							<li>There is no reincarnation / personal immortality</li>
							<li>
								The metaphysical basis for any soul-body clash has been removed
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Types of soul</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>The Vegetative Soul</strong> - Plants - Only vital
								capacities
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>The Sensitive Soul</strong> - Animals - They also have
								sense perception
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>The Rational Soul</strong> - Man - They also have
								mind/reason
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h4>How do the senses work?</h4>
						<p>
							In his account of the senses, how did Aristotle answer the
							Sophists?
						</p>
						<p>
							Part of the time he asserts that the qualities we experience exist
							in things themselves, independently of human perception -
							<i>naive realism</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							The process od sensation is a <i>process</i> - a type of change -
							a passage from potentiality to actuality. It is a dual
							actualization - one which occurs in the sense organ, and one in
							the object being sensed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle observed that when you perceive, th appropriate sense
							organ comes to possess itself the particular quality being sensed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Before you perceive a red object, in itself it is not actually
							red, but te object in reality has the potentiality - the
							potentiality of being perceived in a certain way by a human
							perceiver. In the process of sensation, says Aristotle, this
							potentiality of the object is actualized.
						</p>
						<h4>Process of thought</h4>
						<p>
							In thought, you receive the forms of things, the abstract essences
							or universals, into your mind. In thinking, you take in the forms
							of things, but the matter is irrelevant, so you discard or ignore
							it.
						</p>
						<p>
							If the mind is capable of receiving forms; nothing in the universe
							is closed to it, then what is th nature of the mind if it is able
							to receive, without any distortion, the forms of everything? the
							mind can have <i>no structure or nature</i> of its own.
						</p>
						<p>
							The human mind, has no nature or identity of its own. The mind is
							simply <i>potentiality</i>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The mind is just potentiality, but potentiality cannot actualize
							itself. There must be another aspect of mind that brings it to
							actuality. Mind as potentiality is called "passive reason" and
							mind as the actualizer is called "active reason".
						</p>
						<p>
							The active reason is a kind of spark which operates to actualize
							our potential to know and bring it to fulfillment. There is
							nothing personal about this active reason.

						<h2>
							Aristotle: Universals, Individuation and an Overview of His
							Metaphysics
						</h2>
						<h4>Individuation & Conceptualization</h4>
						<p>There are no individuating elements, only universals.</p>
						<p>
							Individuality, according to Objectivism, is an irreducible
							attribute of all existents: to be <i>is</i> to be particular.
						</p>

					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>
							Aristotle’s Ethics and Politics: Happiness, Reason and the Ideal
							Society
						</h2>
						<p>
							As opposed to Plato, his ethics attempts to be naturalistic,
							this-worldly.
						</p>
						<p>
							As against the Sophists, Aristotle's ethics is not subjectivist.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have to start with the way people actually behave, with what
							they actually believe
						</p>
						<p>
							Ethics rests ultimately on our perceptions of how wise and noble
							Athenians behave. We observe them and the generalize.
						</p>
						<h3>How should we go about systematizing ethics?</h3>
						<p>
							Values are hierarchical. everyone pursues some things for the sake
							of other things.
						</p>
						<p>
							And some ultimate end, some final goal, says Aristotle, must exist
							which we want for its own sake and not simply as a means to
							something else.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong
								>So what <i>is</i> the end, and how do we achieve it?</strong
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							It must be an end in itself; it must be self-sufficient; and it
							must be attainable by man on earth.
						</p>
						<p>
							We must, therefore, take as our given the facts of human nature.
							You can't condemn him for anything that is in his nature.
						</p>
						<p>
							By this approach, the doctrine of Original Sin is impossible. If
							something is <i>inherent</i>, it cannot be sin. Ethics must
							prescribe values and virtues based on the facts of human nature,
							capable of attainment by man here on earth.
							<strong
								>Man, at birth, is neither innately bad or innately good; he is
								morally neutral.</strong
							>
						</p>
						<h5>The ultimate goal which fulfills these traits?</h5>
						<p>
							Happiness - in Greek: <strong>eudaimonia</strong> (it does not
							literally mean "happiness")
						</p>
						<p>
							Eudaimonia implies successful living on all levels; not merely
							emotional enjoyment (<strong>hedone</strong>), but successful
							action, unimpeded thinking; in general, living, functioning and
							acting successfully. It requires not just inner happiness
						</p>
						<p>
							Virtue leads to happiness. The moral man has no conflict between
							his desires and his moral obligations. The moral man recognizes
							that if something is right, it will make him happy. And he gladly
							wants to do what is right - to do it for the sake of his own
							happiness.
						</p>
						<h4>Happiness requires living a certain way.</h4>
						<p>
							Everything acts to achieve, to realize, to actualize its
							distinctive potentialities.
						</p>
						<p>
							If so, what can the good life (eudaimonia) for a thing be, except
							to act as reality and its own nature require?
						</p>
						<p>
							Man has unique potentialities, and the good life consists of
							realizing it.
						</p>
						<h4>
							To be true to his own nature and to the nature of reality, man
							must actualize his distinctive potentiality: <i>reason</i>. The
							life of reason is this the life of happiness.
						</h4>
						<p>2 different uses of "reason"</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Reason which is used to guide life, to regulate the emotions, to
								tell us how to act, he calls "practical reason".
							</li>
							<li>
								reason which is used to acquire knowledge as an end in itself,
								he calls "theoretical" or "contemplative reason".
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The excellent use of practical reason will give us the "moral
							virtues", and the excellent use of the contemplative reason will
							give us the "intellectual virtues".
						</p>
						<h3>Practical reason</h3>
						<p>
							Whatever we do or desire, we can do or desire in different
							amounts: too much, too little and just right - Golden Mean
						</p>
						<p>
							Virtuous behavior will always be the Golden Mean between the two
							extremes: the too much (the "excess") and the too title (the
							"defect").
						</p>
						<p>
							Pride, for Aristotle, is the crows of the virtues. the man of
							pride is his ideal man in terms of the moral virtues (not vanity/
							humility).
						</p>
						<h3>Intellectual reason</h3>
						<p>
							Knowledge on this level is not a means to anything, but an end in
							itself.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this life of contemplation, Aristotle says, you get as close to
							the divine life as you can, because that's all God does, is
							contemplate.
						</p>
						<h3>Egoism</h3>
						<p>
							Aristotle is a thorough egoist. He believes that each man should
							be primarily concerned with the attainment of how
							<i>own</i> happiness, which is to be achieved by the exercise of
							his <i>own</i> practical and theoretical reason.
						</p>
						<p>
							In contrast with the Sophists, Aristotle says that the true egoist
							is the man of reason, not the whim-worshipping brute. Aristotle is
							a consistent champion of rational egoism
						</p>
						<h3>Aristotle's politics</h3>
						<p>
							Aristotle was not a political revolutionary with fundamentally
							original ideas in politics. He objected to Plato's communistic and
							totalitarian views but Aristotle himself was certainly not a major
							individualist either.
						</p>
						<p>
							He objected to the Philosopher King. He also objected to the rule
							by experts on the ground that we must have a government of
							<i>law</i>, not of <i>men</i>; that is a central Aristotelian
							idea.
						</p>
						<h4>What group should have ruling power in the state?</h4>
						<p>
							The best state is a cross between rule of the rich and of the
							poor, rule of the few and of the many; a state ruled neither by
							the mob nor by an elite of experts, but by an intermediate class -
							what we today call the middle class.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle objects to Plato's communism. It's better to leave
							people private property and encourage them to develop a community
							spirit voluntarily so they'll share with others voluntarily.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle and Plato (and the Greeks in general) advocated slavery.
							They has no concept of inalienable rights. Aristotle believed that
							there were rational slaves, men who had the capacity to understand
							a rational argument but not to exercise reason independently, who
							were in effect living tools.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Greeks never really grasped that human beings - all human
							beings - are metaphysically equal.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle also excluded women from citizenship in his state on the
							grounds that they were metaphysically inferior, unlike Plato.
						</p>
						<h3>To sum up Aristotle</h3>
						<p>
							In looking at his overall philosophy, you can point out many
							errors and many bad points.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aristotle laid down the basic principles of a scientific
							Epistemology.
						</p>
						<p>
							he laid down the principles of naturalistic rhizoidal metaphysics.
						</p>
						<p>
							In Ethics, the principles of a this-worldly ethics, according to
							which man's goal is to achieve personal happiness and personal
							pride by exercising his intellectual powers to the fullest.
						</p>
						<h4>
							The pro-reason, pro-life, pro-this-world approach to philosophy,
							in its essence and at root, is the creation of Aristotle.

						>21. Epicurus, Atomic Theory and the Ethics of Hedonism</label
					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Epicurus, Atomic Theory and the Ethics of Hedonism</h2>
						<p>
							What steps did philosophy pass from the heights of Aristotle to
							the depths of Christianity?
						</p>
						<h4>Hellenistic period</h4>
						<p>Four main non-Christian, pagan schools:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The Epicureans</li>
							<li>The Stoics</li>
							<li>The Skeptics</li>
							<li>The Neo-Platonists</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The main concern of the post-Aristotelians was ethics.</p>
						<p>
							Most of these philosophies are called "salvation philosophies",
							because their basic goal is to tell the individual how to achieve
							salvation - inner tranquility and peace amidst the chaos of a
							dissolving world. The goal is not to achieve full life in a
							rational universe, but how to escape bowing too badly hurt in a
							chaotic and, even a hostile, universe.
						</p>
						<h3>Epicurus (343 - 270 BC)</h3>
						<p>His most famous disciple <strong>Lucretius</strong></p>
						<p>
							His goal was to achieve happiness for the individual. The gods
							were one of the main factors inhibiting human happiness. They can
							interfere in human life, to inflict favors in punishment.
						</p>
						<p>People fear death because the soul goes to an unknown realm.</p>
						<p>
							He decided that the best system for his purposes was the Atomism
							of Democritus.
						</p>
						<p>
							The gods are superfluous on this philosophy. Gods are made of
							atoms, they have no power to interfere with human beings; they too
							are just atomic collections. Epicureanism is an atheistic approach
							to philosophy.
						</p>
						<p>
							As far as death is concerned, there is no immortality on the
							Atomist metaphysics. Your consciousness, your personal identity,
							your sense of "you" depends on a complex structure of should atoms
							quivering in a complex structure of body atoms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Epicurus is one of the main originators of the attempt to equate
							free will with causeless action, and thus one of the main
							philosophers to put the concept of "free will" in disrepute
						</p>
						<h4>Epicurus' ethics</h4>
						<p>
							Men want one fundamental thing in life: Pleasure or the avoidance
							of pain, for themselves
						</p>
						<p>
							"Psychological hedonism": is the view that all men by their very
							nature as men necessarily pursue one and only one fundamental goal
							in all of their actions, namely, to gain as much pleasure and/or
							as little pain as possible for themselves.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Ethical hedonism": pleasure, and pleasure alone, is good in
							itself; pain, and pain alone, is bad in itself; everything else is
							to be evaluated depending upon its pleasure/pan consequences
						</p>
						<p>
							Putting it more briefly, ethical hedonism is the doctrine that
							pleasure is the standard of all ethical evaluation. Psychological
							hedonism is a description; ethical hedonism erects an ethics on
							the basis of it.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this kind of world, the more you care about something, the more
							you value it - the more passionately you desire something - the
							more open you are to being hurt, the more vulnerable to pain you
							are.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is nothing you can count on in this world. Of you want
							something from the world, you only open yourself to pain. To
							achieve true happiness, Epicurus concludes, we must value only
							that which is dependent on us ourselves. We have to be
							self-sufficient, and only that way can we be in control and
							invulnerable to the thrusts of a cruel, uncertain world.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can’t change or improve the world; what you can do is stop it
							from affecting you. the ordinary man lets the world stir up in him
							passions, feelings, desires. Consequently, the wise man will
							conquer his emotions, he will stop feeling, he will become
							essentially emotionless, and in that way he will become
							imperturbable, invulnerable.
						</p>
						<h4>Nothing ventures, nothing lost.</h4>
						<p>Three kinds of desire</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Natural & necessary (food, drink, shelter)</li>
							<li>Natural & Unnecessary (sex, fame)</li>
							<li>Unnatural & unnecessary (luxury)</li>

						>22. Stoicism and the Quest for Apathy</label
					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Stoicism and the Quest for Apathy</h2>
						<p>
							The Stoics were, like Epicureans, an enduring school that lasted
							for centuries.
						</p>
						<p>Founder: Zeno</p>
						<p>He lectured from a porch (<strong>stoa</strong>)</p>
						<p>
							Stoicism passed through various phases, altering its doctrines in
							various ways.
						</p>
						<p>
							Their goal saw salvation, serenity, peace of mind of the
							individual in a torn world.
						</p>
						<p>Socrates school: <strong>Cynics</strong></p>
						<p>
							The Cynics (from Greek "cyon", dog) concluded that you should be
							entirely indifferent to your existential fortune, that you should
							scorn all social amenities, even ordinary civilized manners. (like
							dogs)
						</p>
						<p>Popular cynics: Diogenes</p>
						<p>
							Stoic views: We must stop valuing anything in the external world,
							or be in any way dependent on the external world. We must stop
							valuing pleasure, friends, even life.
						</p>
						<p>
							What we must do is achieve utter insensibility - apathy - the
							absence of feeling, non-emotion.
						</p>
						<p>
							The question is how to achieve this state, and what should you do
							once you've reached it?
						</p>
						<h4>The metaphysics of Stoics</h4>
						<p>
							Argument from design: Order in the Universe is the result of a
							designer, soul. Proof of God
						</p>
						<p>
							They did not believe that God is a being existing separately in
							another dimension. Just like the soul is inside the body, God is
							within the Universe.
						</p>
						<h4><i>Pantheism</i> - universe as a whole</h4>
						<p>
							The universe as a whole is matter infused with a semi personal,
							omnipresent mid or soul guiding everything for the best.
						</p>
						<p>Two attributes of this Universe/God</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								It is teleological through and through. Everything happens for
								the best, for a purpose of God's. The Stoics generally had an
								anthropomorphic view of teleology - i.e., the purpose of
								everything was somehow man's welfare
							</li>
							<li>
								Rigid determinism. There is no such thing as free will anywhere
								in the universe, neither in man nor in God. Everything that
								happens is an inevitable expression of God's nature.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							For the Stoics, the universe goes through rigidly fixed cycles.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is known as the doctrine of "eternal return", and it simply
							is a dramatic way of emphasizing the rigid, inexorable rule of
							destiny
						</p>
						<p>Ethics: The problem of freedom</p>
						<h5>Metaphysics summary</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Teleological, deterministic pantheism</li>
							<li>Pantheistic, deterministic teleology</li>
							<li>Teleological, pantheistic determinism</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Stoic epistemology</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The later Roman Stoics emphasized that man was born with certain
								innate ideas, as a God-given cognitive endowment, to enable us
								in effect to start the process of acquiring knowledge
							</li>
							<li>
								When can you claim absolute certainty? Raise, consider, answer
								all possible doubts until a certain point you will suddenly see
								in an incontestable insight that the idea in question is true.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Stoic Ethics</h5>
						<p>
							What is man on this philosophy? If everything is God, man is only
							a part or a part of God. He is not any longer to be viewed as an
							autonomous creature - as an individual, metaphysically - owning
							himself, without allegiance to anything but himself.
						</p>
						<p>
							Man has <i>duties</i> which he must obey - not for reward, for
							gain, for pleasure, but strictly because they are his duties.
						</p>
						<p>
							They made morality an issue of doing what's right because it's
							right.
						</p>
						<p>What are your duties?</p>
						<p>"Live in accordance with your nature, with your reason"</p>
						<p>Two characteristic Stoic duties</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Acceptance. Accept whatever happens to you without wanting it to
								be different. Take the course of events as it comes; yield
								unprotestingly to whatever occurs. Why?
								<ul>
									<li>To protest would be impious - a rebellion against God</li>
									<li>
										Everything is for the best, so it's senseless to get upset
										over it
									</li>
									<li>Everything is inevitable</li>
									<li>
										The "Grand Canyon Argument": What does your particular life
										and petty affairs matter in this context?
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									To achieve this state, the wise man must constantly will down
									the enemy - his passions
								</p>
								<p>
									You value only what's in your power, only the state of doing
									your duty, i.e., virtue. Virtue is an end in itself.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>Altruistic action - you are a part of a whole</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							As is typical of any duty approach to morality, the Stoics
							stressed the importance of <i>motive</i> as the measure of your
							morality, rather than your actual achievements in action in the
							world. All duty moralities hold that since morality has ni
							existential goal or reward, the essence of the moral man is his
							inner compliance with virtue; his attainments in actual reality
							are secondary or unimportant.
						</p>
						<p>The primacy of motive over action is typical to the Stoics</p>
						<p>
							You are allowed 3 emotions; joy at the beauty of the universe, as
							a testament to God's goodness; hope to become virtuous; fear of
							becoming vicious.
						</p>
						<h5>
							The Stoics were the first major school in Western philosophy to
							grasp and to preach what we can call the metaphysical equality of
							all men.

						<h2>
							Ancient Greek Skepticism: Arguing for the Impossibility of
							Knowledge
						</h2>
						<p>
							Epicurus and the Stoics had the confidence in man's ability to
							reach truth by reason and logic
						</p>
						<p>
							This confidence was the target of the next post-Aristotelian
							school, the Skeptics.
						</p>
						<h3>The Skeptics</h3>
						<p>They are a derivative of the Sophists.</p>
						<p>
							Founder: Pyrrho of Elis(360 - 270 BC) - "Pyrrhonian skepticism"
						</p>
						<p>
							The Skeptics held that knowledge of anything is impossible. Even
							this, stated, was not knowledge.
						</p>
						<p>
							Their name comes from the Greek verb <i>skeptesthai</i>, which
							means "to examine carefully, to investigate, to inquire" and they
							were always inquiring and never finding anything.
						</p>
						<p>Why is no knowledge possible?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Sense perception varies with the species, the specific
								individual, the bodily conditions, the various senses of the
								same individual are the same time possible conflicting with each
								other, different relation to the object, the medium between the
								object and you. In sum, we never perceive things as they are.
								reality, therefore, is unknowable.
							</li>
							<li>
								Reason is based on the sense, so it's not better off than the
								senses. Argument from disagreement: everybody claims to have the
								answers, but nobody agrees. Man's reason is incapable of
								objective reason.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Against axioms: To have knowledge we'd have to have infinite
							regress; and since we can't have that, reasoning can never lead us
							to knowledge.
						</p>
						<p>
							The law of cause and effect: You can never perceive by your senses
							a causal connection, and therefore what basis do you have for
							believing in one?
						</p>
						<p>The liar's paradox: Epimenides the Cretan says "I am a liar."</p>
						<p>Skeptics are agnostics on the question of God.</p>
						<h4>What should a wise man do?</h4>
						<p>
							He simply has to do what appears subjectively to him, or conform
							to the moors of the society around him.
						</p>
						<p>
							All these schools - the Epicureans, the Stoics, the Skeptics - are
							converging on the same conclusion - the helplessness of man and
							the hopelessness of life.
						</p>
						<p>
							Salvation depends on looking to another reality, a true, perfect
							reality, a reality of which this world in which we live is simply
							a shadow, a reflection, a semi-real insignificant byproduct.
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowledge, it came to be held, depends upon contact with and
							special help from this superior reality.
						</p>
						<p>
							Happiness, according to this view, is eventual escape from life on
							earth, from the physical, from the body, and the uniting of one's
							soul with true reality.
						</p>
						<p>
							Two main trend within philosophy from about the second century BC
							to about 6th century AD
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								The continuation of ancient pagan philosophy. (Emperor Justinian
								closed Greek universities - 529 AD)
							</li>
							<li>
								The birth and rise to power of Christianity as the major
								philosophic force in the Western world; Christianity did not
								really achieve complete dominance until the fourth or fifth
								century AD
							</li>

						>24. Neoplatonism and the Transition to Christianity</label
					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Neoplatonism and the Transition to Christianity</h2>
						<h4>
							Plotinus (204 - 270 AD) - the leading philosopher of the school
							called "Neo-Platonism"
						</h4>
						<p>
							St. Augustine was heavily influenced by Plotinus, and thereby all
							of Christianity, inasmuch as Augustine was vital to the shaping of
							Christianity.
						</p>
						<h3>Plotinus' Metaphysics</h3>
						<p>
							There is another superior dimension beyond the world in which we
							live. This is a world of change; reality must be unchanging.
						</p>
						<p>
							What is the One like? Nothing. It is ineffable. You can't say
							anything about the One, not even that it exists. It is
							incomprehensible for human reason.
						</p>
						<p>
							This gave rise in later Christianity to the school known as
							"negative theology", which held that you cannot say what God
							<i>is</i>, only what He <i>isn't</i>. because, they said
							(validly), that if you give any characteristic to God, you thereby
							limit him.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first thing to proceed from the One - the second level of
							reality - is a a mind, which Plotinus calls the "divine mind" (the
							world of forms).
						</p>
						<p>
							The third level - the "world soul" - it also thinks, but more like
							us, unlike the "divine mind"
						</p>
						<p>
							Fourth level - individual soul, which emanates bodies, and then
							inhabit them. In other words, the material world as we know it is
							emanated from the world soul as the last level.
						</p>
						<h5>
							We have three nonmaterial principles which ultimately give rise to
							this world: the One, the divine mind, the world soul.
						</h5>
						<h3>The problem of evil</h3>
						<p>
							Evil things occur in the world. If the world is ruled by an
							all-powerful, good power, why do evil things occur.
						</p>
						<p>
							Religions say: Evil doesn't really exist; it's only evil from a
							limited human perspective. People can't understand - mysticism
						</p>
						<h4>Plotinus on the problem of Evil</h4>
						<p>
							Evil is associated with matter, with the physical. Is matter
							positive?
						</p>
						<p>
							If we use the metaphor of the sun, it's been getting darker and
							darker as we leave the One; at some point, it gets really dark,
							there's no more light, we get sheer darkness, and that is matter.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>So matter is not something positive</i>; it is merely that
							region of reality characterized by the absence of the energy, the
							light, the perfection of the One. In itself, matter is unreal, an
							absence, nonbeing.
						</p>
						<p>
							How did Plotinus know this? <i>Ecstasy</i> - the state of
							literally jumping outside the confines of yourself and the world
							and merging with the deity in an incommunicable trance.
						</p>
						<h3>Plotinus' ethics</h3>
						<p>
							The ultimate goal is to leave escape this world. You should live
							ascetically, turn away from the world of pleasures.
						</p>
						<h3>early Christian Philosophy (4th - 5th century AD)</h3>
						<h4>Jesus (4 BC - 29 AD)</h4>
						<p>Jesus was Jewish and believed in the God of Judaism.</p>
						<p>"Christos" = the Messiah</p>
						<p>Paul laid great emphasis on several points</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								The crucial importance of salvation to be achieved by mystic
								union with Jesus
							</li>
							<li>
								Man's utter helplessness and dependence on God's <i>grace</i> -
								i.e., on God's free gift of salvation to man
							</li>
							<li>
								The crucial importance of faith in the teaching and divinity of
								Jesus
							</li>
							<li>
								The crucial importance of leading an ascetic life above all,
								deemphasizing sex, and turning to God as the almost exclusive
								focus and center of one's concern.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							The term "sin" has to be constructed with the secular term "vice",
							or "wrongdoing”.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sin means religious disobedience vs what the Greeks considered to
							be against the nature of man.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's primarily owing to Paul's efforts that this mystery cult
							became a universal religion ("catholic" means universal)
						</p>
						<p>
							There are three main elements contributing to what emerged
							ultimately as Christianity:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Jesus was Jewish; there is therefore a large influence of
								Judaism on Christianity
							</li>
							<li>
								As the Jesus movement became a separate mystery cult, taking
								Jesus as its god, it acquired further mystery cult trappings and
								dogmas that were not possessed by Judaism.
							</li>
							<li>
								As its spokesmen tried to make it intellectually a respectable,
								they borrowed from Greek philosophy. And in so doing, they
								borrowed profoundly from Plato and above all Plotinus
							</li>
						</ol>

						>25. Saint Augustine on Knowledge and Reality</label
					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Saint Augustine on Knowledge and Reality</h2>
						<h3>Augustine (354 - 430 AD)</h3>
						<p>First real philosopher of Christianity.</p>
						<p>He follows Plato. We cannot have knowledge of this world.</p>
						<p>
							He followed Plotinus and thought of the Forms as thoughts in the
							mind of God. True knowledge consists of turning away from this
							world and discovering the Forms in God's mind.
						</p>
						<p>
							God himself must communicate the truths to us. man is dependent on
							God for <i>all</i> knowledge; he's dependent on a special act of
							divine "illumination”.
						</p>
						<p>
							Augustine makes man much more helpless, much more dependent on the
							supernatural.
						</p>
						<p>
							Augustine's main point in regard to faith is that no man can set
							his own reason up as judge of the truth or falsehood of Christian
							teachings.
						</p>
						<p>
							To do so would be to rely on one's puny intellect and commit the
							sin of intellectual pride.
						</p>
						<p>
							That which God has revealed to man must be accepted on faith - it
							must be assented to <i>because</i> it comes from God, even if you
							don't understand why it's true
						</p>
						<p>"one must first believe in order that one may then know."</p>
						<h3>Augustine's metaphysics</h3>
						<p>The central concept is Augustine's concept of "God"</p>
						<p>
							God is, in part, an infinite mind containing the Platonic Forms -
							to that extent, He's like Plotinus' divine mind.
						</p>
						<p>
							God is the only fully <i>real</i> entity; He is immutable,
							perfect, etc. - just like Plato's other world, or the Form of the
							Good.
						</p>
						<p>
							Augustine describes Him as a living, knowing, willing being,
							all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good, the Father of His children
							Who loves them, Who protects them, Who judges them, Who sends His
							son down to help them, etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							Christianity also had the problem of how to conceive the trinity
						</p>
						<p>
							Christianity construes Jesus as a divine being - the son of God,
							and therefore a god himself, so there are 2 gods, yet Christianity
							is monotheistic.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is a trinity, each are God, and yet there is only one God.
							The ultimate position, adopted formally by the Church, was that
							this is a mystery which surpasses human understanding and must be
							accepted on faith.
						</p>
						<p>
							Augustine has to try to make some kind of coherence out of a being
							who has to combine:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the emotionless neo-platonic divine mind</li>
							<li>the primitive Judaic loving, personal Father</li>
							<li>the Christian trinity which is and isn't three</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							God, in Augustine's view, created this world <i>ex nihilo</i> (out
							of nothing) by an act of will, at a particular point in time - a
							profound contrast with any Greek view.
						</p>
						<p>
							All the Greeks, Plotinus included, believed that the universe was
							eternal, that its constituent elements had always existed.
						</p>
						<p>
							God runs every aspect of what occurs in the universe as part of
							His plan. According to Augustine, God alone has causal efficacy in
							the universe. Everything is determined by God.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the Christian view, life on earth is like a play by
							Shakespeare, and it becomes meaningful to ask, "What does it
							mean?", "What did the Author have in mind?"
						</p>
						<p>
							The <i>fact</i> of existence is not a primary, but a mystery which
							requires unravelling. Everything is a symbol pointing beyond
							itself to God.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Why did God include so much evil, so much suffering, in His
							play?"
						</p>
						<p>
							The Manichee’s (a sect to which Augustine belonged to as a youth)
							thought the only solution was to say that God is limited, that
							there is a Devil and <i>he</i> is responsible for evil.
							Christianity repudiated this as heretical.
						</p>
						<p>
							Why does God allow evil? If you saw God's purpose, you would see
							that everything is really good.
						</p>
						<p>
							Augustine takes the Neo-platonic view that evil is the absence if
							the perfection and reality that is inherent in the creature being
							<i>non</i>-God
						</p>
						<p>
							All things in this world are necessarily infected with a
							<i>metaphysical</i> deficiency.
						</p>
						<p>
							It follows that <i>all</i> men, insofar as they're semi-real
							members of this semi-real world, are also inherently infected with
							evil.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Pelagius</strong> held that each human should enters the
							world sinless, that it has free will, is capable on its own of
							shaping its destiny by its own choices, and therefore is
							responsible for its own actions, and properly by God. He denied
							any intrinsic wickedness in man.
						</p>
						<p>
							Free will is incompatible with man's inherent evil, and with God's
							rigid predestination, with the doctrine that <i>only</i> God has
							causal efficacy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Christianity is deterministic on many counts; it is incapable of
							accepting determinism consistently.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is no possible solution on his premises, and every solution
							Augustine gives he contradicts elsewhere.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the issue of evil and freedom, therefore, the upshot is a mass
							of contradictions in Augustine and in Christianity
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								God is the cause of everything; and yet, He is not responsible
								for evil
							</li>
							<li>
								This world and man are inherently evil; and yet man is
								responsible for his sins and properly to be condemned by God for
								them
							</li>
							<li>
								Man is helpless to be virtuous on his own, yet he is to bear
								responsibility for vices he cannot alter.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Augustine agrees with Plato and Plotinus that this world is not
							fully real. It is kind of shadowy reflection of true reality -
							i.e., of the realm of God.

						>26. Saint Augustine and the Ethics of Christianity</label
					>
					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Saint Augustine and the Ethics of Christianity</h2>
						<h3>Augustine's ethics</h3>
						<p>
							The essence is not the matter of right <i>living</i> but of right
							<i>loving</i>. The essence of the good life is not in what you
							accomplish or create during this life, but in giving the proper
							inner emotional allegiance to the true dimension, to God. This is
							the primacy of <i>motive over action</i> that we saw in discussing
							the Stoics - the primacy of the <i>inner over the outer</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							It can be called the primacy of the consciousness over existence.
							In this sense it's the soul-body dichotomy present in Greek
							thought since the Pythagoreans and Orphics.
						</p>
						<p>
							Man is a temporary union of 2 distinct substances: the soul and
							the body.
						</p>
						<p>All that counts is escape - i.e., reunion with God in Heaven.</p>
						<p>
							If all men are corrupt, how does God decide whom to select for
							Heaven? It is inexplicable to man.
						</p>
						<p>The utter dependence of man on God</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								In epistemology, man depends on God's illumination for
								knowledge.
							</li>
							<li>In ethics, he depends on God's grace for virtue</li>
							<li>
								In metaphysics, man is a semi-real creature, created, run and
								ruled by God.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Why have ethics? You can't achieve ethics on earth, you can't earn
							entry into heaven. That is a corrupt question. God has commanded
							that you act in certain ways, and these commandments must be
							obeyed because God commanded them. The highest virtue is obedience
							to God, doing your duty because it is your duty.
						</p>
						<p>
							Christianity is definitely inconsistent on this point. There are
							several anti-duty, pro-egoist elements:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								There is an emphasis on the salvation of your own individual
								soul.
							</li>
							<li>
								You will be rewarded with eternal happiness of you make it to
								heaven - and it's your <i>own</i> eternal happiness that you
								will experience.
							</li>
							<li>
								"Love thy neighbor as thyself" implies that you can love
								yourself to some extent.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							All of these elements of egoism are legacies of the Greek
							influence on Christianity.
						</p>
						<h4>What is it that God commands?</h4>
						<p>
							What He wants primarily is that man should turn away from life on
							earth and turn his attention to God.
						</p>
						<p>
							"He that loveth his life shall lose it; he that hateth it shall
							gain it unto ife eternal"
						</p>
						<p>
							By the time of Christianity, <i>suffering as such</i> - that is,
							on earth - as become a value.
						</p>
						<p>
							"The problem of pleasure" - how to sustain yourself in the most
							frugal way without enjoying it.
						</p>
						<p>
							What should you attitude be to yourself? You should recognize the
							facts: you're stained with sin, you're worthless, and you should
							estimate yourself accordingly.
						</p>
						<p>
							Consequently, the great virtue is <i>humility</i>; the great vice
							is pride
						</p>
						<p>
							Science and learning represent lusts also this-worldly loves and
							concerns which are futile and to be suspended
						</p>
						<p>
							It's arrogant of puny man to pursue science on his own - what God
							wants man to know, God will reveal in his own good time.
						</p>
						<p>
							The answer to everything is: "That is how it is because God wills
							it"
						</p>
						<p>
							Your distinctive virtue, qua Christian, is to love men who do
							<i>not</i> meet your standards, who do <i>not</i> give you
							pleasure, to love men who are out to <i>harm</i> you - "Love your
							enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that
							despitefully use and persecute you"

						<h2>
							The Dark Ages, Medieval Scholasticism and the Rediscovery of
							Aristotle
						</h2>
						<p>
							"Scholasticism" is a general name for the philosophy of the whole
							Middle Age period, especially from the last half of the 11th -
							14th centuries
						</p>
						<p>
							Philosophy, for them, was an attempt to substantiate rationally
							and to harmonize the dogmas of the appropriate authorities.
						</p>
						<p>No comprehensive philosophic systems.</p>
						<p>Are universals real or not?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Platonism - universals are real, separate from particulars.
								Heavily criticized on the <i>theological</i> grounds.
							</li>
							<li>
								Nominalism - only particulars exist, each is through and through
								unique. Universals are names that people attribute to groups of
								particulars. This makes all conceptual thought completely
								arbitrary and detached from reality.
							</li>
							<li>
								Middle position - "moderate realism". Only particulars exist,
								but human beings, by abstraction, are able to discover a common
								nature in a number of particulars. The universal, white it
								exists in one sense only in the mind - as an abstraction - is
								not subjective fiction because individual things do have common
								properties which form an objective basis for out abstractions
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							To some, reason was a dangerous enemy of Christianity and the
							whole attempt of the Scholastic to make sense of the dogmas was
							depraved (Bernard of Clairvaux)
						</p>
						<p>
							You start with faith. Faith is the basis of reason, and maybe
							there'll be bits of the faith or large hunks that you can't
							explain, but that's simply temporary so you couldn't possibly
							criticize faith.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anselm worked out an argument for the existence of God which
							became very famous - it's called the "ontological argument":
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								From the very term "God" you can prove that He exists. Simply
								granting that you have an idea of God - and everybody has an
								idea of God. God is "the being than which nothing greater can be
								conceived". Between 2 identical gods, the one who exists is
								better. "I have a concept of an absolutely perfect being, but he
								doesn't exist," you're saying: "I have a concept of an
								absolutely perfect Being who lacks a perfection," which is a
								contradiction. Logic itself demands the existence of God.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Aristotle was rediscovered in the 13th century. What did Aristotle
							have to say and how did it relate to Christianity?
						</p>
						<h4>Metaphysics</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Aristotle - One reality, nature: fully real, the world: eternal,
								fully natural, God: Unmoved mover, personal immortality: none
							</li>
							<li>
								Christianity - 2 realities, nature: semi-real, the world:
								created ex nihilo, God: omniscient, personal immortality:
								crucial
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Epistemology</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Aristotle - sensory experience, logic</li>
							<li>Christianity - faith</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Ethics</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Aristotle - man is proud, self-sufficient, capable, goal:
								happiness
							</li>
							<li>
								Christianity - sordid, stained with sin, helpless, goal: escape
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							In spite of the Church, the best men set to work to try to
							reconcile Aristotle and Christianity.

						<h2>
							Thomas Aquinas: The Union of Aristotelianism and Christianity
						</h2>
						<h5>Thomas Aquinas (1225 - 1275)</h5>
						<p>
							He has a monumental, ingenious philosophic system, more through,
							more systematic, than any in all of philosophy prior to his time.
							It is an attempted synthesis of Aristotle and Christianity.
						</p>
						<h3>Epistemology</h3>
						<p>
							The main problem was to reconcile reason and faith. Aquinas did so
							by distinguishing between philosophy and theology.
						</p>
						<p>
							Philosophy begins with the evidence of the senses and proceeds
							strictly by reason and logic. It's a completely natural subject.
						</p>
						<p>
							Theology begins with the dogmas of faith, with the revelations,
							and then tries to explore and explicate their full meaning
						</p>
						<p>
							Philosophy is primarily concerned with the facts of this world.
							Theology is primarily concerned with the mysteries of religion.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Natural knowledge</li>
							<li>revealed knowledge</li>
							<li>middle - "natural theology"</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Revealed theology: what is its relation to reason and philosophy?
						</p>
						<p>
							Answer: revelation can in no way contradict reason; it can
							maintain nothing that can be rationally refuted
						</p>
						<p>
							This view was a charter of liberty and liberation for human
							reason. Reason requires no special divine aid.
						</p>
						<p>For Augustine, faith is the <i>basis</i> of reason</p>
						<p>For Tertullian, faith <i>contradicts</i> reason</p>
						<p>
							For Aquinas, faith is not the basis or antagonist of reason,
							merely a <i>supplement</i> to it.
						</p>
						<h3>Metaphysics</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								A supernatural God is the creator and source of this world
							</li>
							<li>God's mind contains the Platonic Forms</li>
							<li>
								The relative unreality of this world compared to the true
								reality of God
							</li>
							<li>
								All the Catholic dogmas: the trinity, the incarnation, etc.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Aristotelian Metaphysics</h4>
						<p>
							The central problem confronting Aquinas in metaphysics is how to
							reconcile God and this world.
						</p>
						<p>
							He took over from Aristotle the view that there is only one
							reality, but that it is <i>hierarchical</i> in nature - there are
							various levels of reality depending upon the extent to which form
							is actualized.
						</p>
						<p>
							Nature is merely a lower level of the one continuous hierarchy.
						</p>
						<p>
							On this view of Aquinas', science is metaphysically possible
							again.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>How</i> is science possible? For Aquinas, God created the world
							<i>ex nihilo</i> - everything happens as He ordains by His will.
							An orderly, lawful, regular universe where entities act in accord
							with their natures is part of what God wills - a scientifically
							understandable universe is part of His plan.
						</p>
						<p>
							So <i>ultimately</i> only God has causal efficacy, but He
							expresses it by endowing His creatures with causal efficacy.
						</p>
						<p>
							God can intervene directly at any time - that will be a miracle.
						</p>
						<h4>Aquinas' arguments for the existence of God</h4>
						<p>There are 5 famous arguments - none of them original with him</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>The argument from motion</strong> - it literally
								restates Aristotle's argument for the Prime Mover, arguing that
								motion implies a first mover
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>The argument from efficient causation</strong> -
								<ul>
									<li>
										Everything has an efficient cause which brought it into
										existence
									</li>
									<li>Nothing can be the efficient cause of itself</li>
									<li>So everything is caused by something previous</li>
									<li>But we can't have an infinite regress</li>
									<li>
										He concludes: there must be an uncaused cause, a
										<i>first cause</i>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>The argument from necessity and contingency</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Some entities are contingent - it's possible for them not to
										exist
									</li>
									<li>
										It is not possible that all entities could be contingent
										(e.g., Existence)
									</li>
									<li>Therefore, something must be necessary</li>
									<li>
										If so, either it's necessary <i>by its own nature</i>, or it
										owes its necessity to something <i>else</i>
									</li>
									<li>But we can't have an infinite regress</li>
									<li>
										And this is what we mean by God - the absolutely necessary
										being
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>The argument from degrees</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										There are degrees of various qualities that we observe
									</li>
									<li>
										Where there are degrees of quality, there must be an
										absolute maximum of the quality somewhere, which is the
										cause of its existence in all the lesser degrees
									</li>
									<li>There are degrees of goodness</li>
									<li>
										There must therefore be a maximum of goodness which causes
										all the lesser degrees of goodness, <i>absolute</i> goodness
										or perfection
									</li>
									<li>And this is God</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>The teleological argument</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>There is order in the world</li>
									<li>Order implies final causation, teleology</li>
									<li>
										And teleology implies a conscious being who is imposing the
										purpose or end or goal on things
									</li>
									<li>
										So there must <i>be</i> such a cosmic consciousness, namely
										God
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Now he has to show that the God he has proved is the God of
							Christianity. But how do you get there?
						</p>
						<h3>Ethics</h3>
						<p>
							Here again he attempted to reconcile Aristotle with Christianity
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Natural virtues</li>
							<li>Teleological virtues</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The natural virtues are Aristotelian (self-realization, the
							all-round development of one's capacities, living by reason,
							satisfying your this worldly desires to a moderate extent,
							happiness on earth)
						</p>
						<p>
							This side is discoverable by reason alone, and to some degree man
							can achieve the natural virtues by his own efforts
						</p>
						<p>
							Beside the natural, rational virtues, there are the theological
							virtues: faith, hope, charity. They cannot be proved by reason.
							they depend on God's revelation for us to know that they're
							virtues. And they cannot be attained by our own efforts, only by
							God's grace.
						</p>
						<p>he accepted the proclaimed official Church dogma.</p>
						<h3>Politics</h3>
						<p>
							Just as grace perfects nature, so the Church perfects the State;
							and just as God is supreme over nature, therefore the Church must
							be supreme over the State.

						<h2>
							The Separation of Faith and Reason: The Transition from the Middle
							Ages to the Renaissance
						</h2>
						<p>
							During the Renaissance, men typically did not dispute the
							existence of God or the veracity of revelations or original sin or
							the incarnation or the whole slew of dogmas. They simply didn't
							focus on them anymore in anything like the manner that they had
							prior to the Renaissance.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a fundamental, controlling, exclusive concern in human life,
							religious supernaturalism died in the Renaissance, never to
							recover.
						</p>
						<p>After Aquinas, philosophy and theology fell apart altogether</p>
						<p>
							When this occurred, philosophy lost all essential connection with
							theology, and the Scholastic enterprise collapsed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Theological issues were no longer of relevance to the philosopher;
							they were matters of faith.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity" - Occam's
							Razor - it slashes the occult
						</p>
						<h4>The doctrine of the twofold truth</h4>
						<p>
							Faith and reason are inherently in conflict: there is the truth in
							theology and the truth in philosophy
