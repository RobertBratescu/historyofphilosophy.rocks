  <h2>Introduction to philosophy</h2>
  <p>Philein (to love) + sophia (wisdom)</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Metaphysics - studies the nature of universe as a whole</li>
    <li>Epistemology - defines the nature and means of human knowledge</li>
    <li>*Psiloshophical psychology - the application of Metaphysics and Epistemology to philosopher's view on the nature of man</li>
    <li>Ethics - defines a code of values to guide human choices and actions</li>
    <li>Politics - defines the proper nature of society, and particularly the proper functions of government</li>
    <li>Esthetics - defines the nature and purpose of art, and the standards by which it is to be objectively evaluated</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>3 basic questions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>"What is there?"(Metaphysics)</li>
    <li>"How do you know?"(Ethics)</li>
    <li>"So what?"(Ethics and Politics)</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><strong>Philosophy</strong> is the subject which studies the nature of the universe, and of man's means of knowing the universe, and which on this basis provides a code of values to guide human actions and institutions.</h3>

  <p>First systematic philosopher: Plato</p>

<div class="tab-click" data-tab="lesson2">Thales of Miletus and the Birth of Greek Philosophy</div>
<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson2">
  <h2>Thales of Miletus and the Birth of Greek Philosophy</h2>
  <p>Philosophy developed in Greece because Greece was an exception on the view of the world.</p>
  <h3>What made it possible?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Greeks had achieved a comparative degree of political freedom</li>
    <li>Peculiar religion - Gods were not creators of the world; not its rulers or directors</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They believed in a shadowy immortality, but they didn't yearn for it; a pro-<i>this</i>-life attitude</p>

  <h3>What did they think about?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Change & Multiplicity</strong><br>
      Change - anything that happens (occurence, event, motion, activity) <br>
      Multiplicity (many) - There are many things in the worls. What is the <i>relationship</i> between all of these different things?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Father of Philosophy: Thales of Miletus (585 BC)</h3>
  <p>School: Miletians</p>
  <p>There is one <i>fundamental stuff</i> which makes up the entire univers: a "world stuff" (Monism)</p>
  <p>Everything is just many different forms of that one stuff</p>
  <p>Thales was looking for <u>the one in the many</u></p>
  <p>Thales thought that that "world stuff" was <u>water</u></p>
  <p>He established a naturalistic apporach to the world, he introduced the idea that there are natural laws governing what takes place.</p>

<div class="tab-click" data-tab="lesson3">Heraclitus of Ephesus: A World of Change and Contradiction</div>
<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson3">
  <h2>Heraclitus of Ephesus: A World of Change and Contradiction</h2>
  <p>Heraclitus (500 BC) - the first enduringly influencial philosopher</p>
  <p>"the dark" - offered oracular aphorisms without explanation</p>
  <p>All-out attack on the law of identity</p>
  <p>Change is incompatible with the laws of logic - change requires the existence of contradictions</p>
  <p>Something can be A and not-A at the same time</p>
  <p>Change necessarily requires contradictions</p>
  <p>Everything is Change. The "world stuff" is change itself</p>
  <p>The essence of reality is <i>change</i></p>
  <p>Everything is changing, in every respect, at every instant.</p>
  <p>"You can't step into the same river twice, for fresh waters are always flowing in"</p>
  <p>There are no entities</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Nothing is; everything is becoming"</li>
    <li>"Everything flows and nothing abides"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is a <i>process philosophy</i> because it holds that process, activity, motion, change, is reality.</p>
  <p>Heraclitus' follower: Cratylus, also teacher of Plato</p>
  <p>He stopped talking on principle, on the grounds that there is no way to give words meaning.</p>
  <p>Epistemology: The first man to regard the senses as invalid. by the means of our senses, it <i>appears</i> that there are permanent, motionless, inchanging things, which is not true, so senses are deceptive.</p>
  <p>2 realms: Reality vs Appearance</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reality is that which really exists. Known by reason, apart from the senses</li>
    <li>Appearance is that which appears to us</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Reason as opposed to the sense = RATIONALIST</p>

<div class="tab-click" data-tab="lesson4">Parmenides of Elea: Logic Demands a Changeless Universe</div>
<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson4">
  <h2>Parmenides of Elea: Logic Demands a Changeless Universe</h2>
  <p>Parmenides (480 BC) - Eleiaticism / Eleiatic philosophy</p>
  <p>The first to support convictions with reasoned argument</p>
  <p>Basic principle: <strong>What is, is, and what is not, is not, and what is not can neither be, nor be thought about</strong></p>
  <h3>Systematic deductions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The universe must be uncreated.</li>
    <li>The universe must be indestructable; it could never go out of existence. The universe is therefore eternal.</li>
    <li>Can there be such a thing as a vacuum? Absolutely not. The universe is a plenum (full).</li>
    <li>Change is impossible - change of any kind</li>
  </ol>
  <p>"Father of Logic"</p>
  <p>A seed growing into a flower. The seed is what is, the flower is what is not. The seed disappears and the flower appears. Change is a double violation of his principle: every change is a simultaneous passage from what is to what is not, ant
    what
    is not to what is. But there is no "what is not".</p>
  <p>Agreement with Heraclitus: Change implies a contradiction - a violation of logic</p>
  <p>Parmenides went on to deny multiplicity. It is an illusion.</p>
  <p>Epistemologically: Rationalism</p>
  <p>Parmenides' follower: Zeno (490 - 430 BC)</p>
  <p>Paradoxes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Motion is impossible <br>
      It's impossible to cross a room. You have to cross half of it, and half of that, etc. You can subdivide infinitely. <br>
      Applies to talking.
    </li>
    <li>Multiplicity is impossible <br>
      Multiplicity is the view that the world consists of a number of things. The world can't be a whole composed of parts. <br>
      <ul>
        <li>If the world is a whole with parts, what size would the universe be and how many parts does it have? Infinite number of parts because every magnitude is theoretically divisible without limit and if there's an infinite number of parts
          we
          must have an infinitely big universe</li>
        <li>What will be the size of the ultimate parts of the universe? There has to be such ultimate indivisible parts. But any magnitude is divisible. So the ultimate parts must be zero in size</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson5">
  <h2>Pythagoras: Mathematics and the Mysticism of the Orphan Religion</h2>
  <p>Pythagoras (530 BC) & the Pythagoreans</p>
  <p>Mystic sect. First religious philosophers</p>
  <p>Mystery religion - Orphic mystery religion</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Man has 2 parts. High and low. The high is the soul, the low part is the body. They are in eternal confliict</li>
    <li>The sould is akin to God but fell from grace</li>
    <li>As a punishment the soul was put in the body, the body is a prison.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Long series of reincarnations, the gols is to stop.</p>
  <p>Primary source of the soul-body opposition.</p>
  <p>They discovered that Mathematics was somehow everywhere. Music, Astronomy, Medicine</p>
  <p>They represented numbers by physical things.</p>
  <p>They confused numbers with the physical entities which they represent.</p>
  <p>The crucial point is the vital impotance of mathematics in discovering the laws of the world</p>
  <p>Modern physics would have been impossible without the discovery that physical laws have to be formulated in mathematics.</p>
  <p>Numbers or numerical relations govern the behaviour of things.</p>
  <h3>Metaphysical Dualism (2 realitites):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The world of number - can't be grasped by the sense, is immutable</li>
    <li>This world - can be grasped by the sense, constantly changing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The MD solved the Parmenidean - Heraclitean dilemma.</p>
  <h3>To be true knowledge, something must be mathematical.</h3>
  <p>Major legacies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mind-body dichotomy</li>
    <li>The ultimate goal is to escape the body</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can't commit suicide because you belong to God</p>
  <p>Ethics: Purify yourself by withdrawing from the physical</p>
  <p>3 types of men who come to the Olympic games</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The lowest - the guy who comes to make money</li>
    <li>The athletes - desire for something more spiritual (honor, glory), but still materialistic</li>
    <li>The highest, the spectators - simply want to look out and see what's happening, want to acquire knowledge in a disinterested way</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Supreme importance of knowledge so long as it is disinterested - severing knowledge from life, knowledge is an end in itself.</p>

<div class="tab-click" data-tab="lesson6">The Pluralists, the Atomists and the Birth of Determinism</div>
<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson6">
  <h2>The Pluralists, the Atomists and the Birth of Determinism</h2>
  <p>3 kinds of philosophy formulated in Greece that endure to this day</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Materialism - metaphysics - reality is matter in motion, mental phenomenon are to be explained entirely in physical, marterial terms(implied by Thales)</li>
    <li>Skepticism - no objective knowledge of anything is possible. What we call "knowledge" is really a guess, hunch, subjective feeling, a probability, but not true knowledge (derivative of Heraclitus)</li>
    <li>Idealism - metaphysics - reality is basically non-material; the material world is simply a byproduct or expression of something non-material in character (derivative of Pythagoreans)</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>The Atomists</h3>
  <p>The outcome of a different attempt to reconcile Parmenides and Heraclitus - Pluralists</p>
  <p>Abandoned Monism (the view that there is only one "world stuff"). There are many different stuffs which make up the world</p>
  <p>Locomotion is the only type of change permitted. It is simply a rearrangement of the stuffs that always exist.</p>
  <h4>Empedocles (490 - 435 BC)</h4>
  <p>There were 4 stuffs - earth, air, water & fire</p>
  <h4>Anaxagoras (500 BC)</h4>
  <p>If there are no new qualities, there has to be more than 4 stuffs. Banana stuff, hair stuff, etc.</p>
  <p>Little tiny bits of all these stuffs are in everything ("seeds"), then change would really be a rearrangement.</p>
  <h3>Leucippus (6th BC) & Democritus (460 - 360 BC)</h3>
  <p>2 kinds of characteristics</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Qualities - colors, sounds, odors, etc.</li>
    <li>Quantities - size, shape, motion/ rest, number</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Strip qualities from the things altogether. No qualities are real. What we call qualities are the subjective effects on human beings.</p>
  <p>Reality consists of little, tiny Parmenidean One solidly packed and therefore uncuttable</p>
  <p>Atoms - from "atome", meaning uncuttable</p>
  <p>There must be empty space between atoms.</p>
  <p>Reality consists of</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Atoms</li>
    <li>The void</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Nothing ever happens by chance, nothing ever happens for a purpose, end or goal - Mechanistic Materialism</p>
  <h3>Mechanism - everything happens according to the laws of mechanics; contrasted with teleology - the idea that purpose is operative somewhere in the universe</h3>
  <p>Man is governed by rigid Determinism</p>
  <p>The soul is made of soul atoms - they are completely physical and they are diffused throughout the world.</p>
  <p>Consciousness is a quivering of the soul atoms</p>
  <p>Epistemology: You cannot rely on your senses</p>
  <p>Convention: anything which is a product of man's subjective constitution, as against the actual facts of reality.</p>
  <p>They are philosophical rationalists.</p>
  <p>Mechanistic materialism as a metaphysics is completely invvalid, because it denies the existence of mind, and as such, it's self-refuting</p>
  <h4>Reductive materialism - everything is the material - love is hormones</h4>
  <h4>Epiphenomenalism - everything is a helpless cause of physical events - love is provoked by the hormones</h4>

<div class="tab-click" data-tab="lesson7">The Skepticism of the Greek Sophists</div>
<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson7">
  <h2>The Skepticism of the Greek Sophists</h2>
  <p>Sophists were a professional class in the 5th BC</p>
  <p>How to win firends, gain political power.</p>
  <p>They received money from teaching philosophy - regarded immoral</p>
  <h3>Protagoras (480 - 410 BC) and Gorgias (483 - 375 BC)</h3>
  <p>The sophists were the first avowed skeptics in history.</p>
  <p>All out attack on the senses.</p>
  <p>Whenever we perceive, what we perceive depends upon 2 factors</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The object being perceived</li>
    <li>The nature and condition of your sensory apparatus (ex. daltonism, size of the sun and distance)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Nobody is right because nobody cand perceive reality except as processed by his particular sensory. All you can really know is what appears to you.</p>
  <p>There is no "it is", only "it appears to me". Each of us lives in our own subjective world. </p>
  <p>2 truths:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Perception is impossible without sensory organs</li>
    <li>The type of organs that you have affects the type of experience you have</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Protagoras: You can never perceive reality</p>
  <p>Reason depende on the evidence of the senses, but since the sense show us our own subjective world ("true for me").</p>
  <p>The argument from disagreement: Everybody disagrees about what is rational; who is to sau what's really true?</p>
  <p>Everything is constantly changing so nothing is an absolute ("it seems to be <strong>now</strong>")</p>
  <p>Protagoras: Man is the measure of all things, of things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not.</p>
  <p>Cycle of philosophy: A constructive era collapses into total skepticism, and then the beginning of a new one, collapsing into a still deeper skepticism</p>
  <p>Sophists are agnostics</p>
  <p>There is no objective ethics. Complete ethical subjectivists and complete ethical relativists. Virtue is an arbitrary social convention.</p>
  <p>Resolve conflicts through brute physical force</p>
  <p>Egoism - do not sacrifice for others</p>

<div class="tab-click" data-tab="lesson8">The Life and teachings of Socrates</div>
<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson8">
  <h2>The Life and teachings of Socrates</h2>
  <p>Socrates and Plato set out to answer the Sophists - to ground objective knowledge and objective morality</p>
  <p>They founded the first complete philosophy</p>
  <h3>Socrates (470 - 400 BC)</h3>
  <p>Socrates left no writings; he is known primarily through PLato's dialogues.</p>
  <p>Socrates' interest was in ethics.</p>
  <h3>Socrates' Method</h3>
  <p>"The unexamined life is not worth living"</p>
  <p>He was arrested - charged with corrupting the youth and worshipping false gods. The court voted for death by hemlock.</p>
  <p>First Philosophic martyr</p>
  <p>His story is cotained in 3 dialogues of Plato:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Apology - trial</li>
    <li>Crito - time in prison</li>
    <li>Phaedo - last hours of Socrates</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Father of Definitions</h4>
  <p>How to define - statement of the characteristics that are common to some class - those characteristics possessed by every member of the class, in virtue of which they're members of that class</p>
  <p>You concentrate when you want a definition not on <i>particulars</i>, but on <i>universals</i></p>
  <p>The crucial problem of human knowledge was the knowledge of universals.</p>
  <p>Wherever we have a word, we have a universal</p>
  <p>Man is distinctive through his ability to distinguish universals</p>
  <p>Importance of conceptual, as distinct from the perceptual</p>
  <p>Humans have to rise toe the conceptual stage

<div class="tab-click" data-tab="lesson9">Plato's Metaphysics: The Perceptible World and the World of Ideal Forms</div>
<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson9">
  <h2>Plato's Metaphysics: The Perceptible World and the World of Ideal Forms</h2>
  <h3>Plato (427 - 347 BC)</h3>
  <p>Founded the first university of the Western World- The Academy</p>
  <p>One of 2 most influential philosophers of all time</p>
  <p>He is the first great philosophic genius in human history in 3 ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>his abstract ability</li>
    <li>his originality</li>
    <li>his power of systematic integration</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Metaphysics</h3>
  <p>Agreed with Socrates - knowledge was the knowledge of universals</p>
  <p>Premise: universals must be knowable -> then, they must exist</p>
  <p>Where/ How do they exist? - <i>the problem of universals</i></p>
  <p>Universals and particulars have radically different characteristics -> radically different <i>kinds</i> of things</p>
  <p>Two world: one with characteristics of universals, one with characteristics of particulars</p>
  <h4>Argument 1: The Argument from the Differences between Universals and Particulars</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>There is one universal per category, but many particulars</li>
    <li>Particulars change, universals go on unchanging</li>
    <li>Particulars are primarily material; universals are abstract, nonphysical</li>
    <li>Particulars are known by means of the senses; universals are known by reason, intelect</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Argument 2: The Argument of Perfection</h4>
  <p>Where do we get our concepts and standards of perfection</p>
  <p>There is no such thing as a perfection in <i>this</i> world</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Things in this world change. If a thing changes, it couldn't be perfect, it would simply stand still, it would lack nothing</li>
    <li>Even in mathematics, the Platonists say, you'll never find perfection (perfect triangle, perfect line).</li>
    <li>We criticize things as imperfect; this presupposes that we know what perfection would consist of - and we couldn't have got it from this world</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When we think of a universal, we usually have a perfect, unblemished representative in mind. The world of perfection is precisely the world of universals.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Innate ideas - i.e., knowledge possessd in us at birth.</li>
    <li>The soul must be independent of the body - the groundwork to establish the immortality of the soul</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Argument 3: The Argument from the Order of Knowledge</h4>
  <p>Which, in logic, would you have to learn first: universals or particulars?</p>
  <p>Plato says it's impossible to know particulars. It is impossible to collect particular instances of justice and then abstract from them the concept of "justice". You must know beforehand what justice looks like.</p>
  <p>There must be a realm of universals independent of this world which we knew before this life. We were born with all this knowledge, it's unconscious and we have to <i>unearth</i> it</p>
  <h4>Argument 4: The Argument from the Possibility of Knowledge</h4>
  <ol>
    <il>You can't know a world of flux, but this world is a world of flux. If reality is to be knowable, it must be immutable - that means another world.</il>
    <li>If a world is changing, it's contradictory, and you can't know the contradictory. If a world is to be knowable, it must be made of consistent entities, entities which don't change.</li>
    <li>Knowledge acquired by the senses is invalid. Knowledges of reality must be acwuired by <i>non-sensory</i> means; and thus it must be of a <i>non-material</i> object.</li>
    <li>The crucial thing to know is universals, and universals have all the characteristics that the world that's knowable has to have - they're immutable, self-consistent, motionless, non-material</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Conclusion: if there's to be knowledge of reality at all, it must be of a world of universals, and not of this world.</h5>
  <p>True knowledge is knowledge of the other world - the world of universals, which includes numbers and everything else that has instances, actual or possible</p>
  <p>The world of universals - also called the world of Essences, Forms, Ideas, or the Intelligible World</p>
  <p>The world of particulars - or the physical world, or the sensible world - the world you grasp by the senses</p>
  <h4>Differences:</h4>
  <p>Universals are independent of the particulars in this world, and they are independent of our thoughts. <strong>Universals are actual entities, things, real, external objects, but not physical</strong>. For every class of particulars, there
    is a
    corresponding universal. Particulars are not really knowable. true knowledge is always knowledge of the forms.</p>
  <p>Of the 2 worlds, Plato regarded the world of Forms as real.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Test 1: To be real, a thing has to exist. It can't be contradictory. But, to be non-contradictory, it has to be motionless, because change involves a contradiction. The things in this world are contradictory.</li>
    <li>Test 2: A thing is real when it's knowable. If knowledge is of reality, and knowledge is only of the world of Forms, then the world of Forms is reality, not this world.</li>
    <li>Test 3: The real is the perfect - the ideal</li>
    <li>Test 4: The real is the original, as against imitations. The World of Forms is original, the res is imitation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What is the status of <i>this</i> world in which we live?</p>
  <p>It's like a byproduct, derivative, projection, or reflection of true reality. (in a fun house mirror show, you are the world of forms and the distortions in the mirrors are this world)</p>
  <h4>This world is the world of Forms reflected, or projected, into a medium</h4>
  <p>Space is the medium which enables the Forms to take on physical location.</p>
  <h4>Plato did not believe this world was created <i>ex nihilo</i> (out of nothing).</h4>
  <h3>The myth of the Demiurge</h3>
  <p>The Demiurge is a sort of godlike, but very limited, soul that wanders freely in the universe.</p>
  <p>With one eye on the perfection of the world of Forms, he shaped and organized the matter like an architect to produce as much order, harmony, symmetry, perfection as he could.</p>
  <p>This is the most primitive form of the <i>Argument from Design</i> for the existence of God.</p>
  <p>The Demiurge left an imperfection: nothing</p>
  <h4>The Form of the Good - the ultimate Form in hte world of Forms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Metaphysically, it is the <i>purpose</i> of all existence and the <i>source</i> of existence.</li>
    <li>Epistemologically, it is the source of all intelligibility - it's what makes anything understandable</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Plato believed that the Form of the Good is <i>ineffable</i>. To grasp it, you must have a vision which is self-illuminating.</p>
  <p>This is <i>mysticism</i> - the view that knowledge is obtainable by means other than reason or senses.</p>
  <h3>To sum up Plato's metaphysics:</h3>
  <p>There is a world of Forms, presided over by the Form of the Good, all of it reflected into space, thereby generating this half-real reflection that we call the pysical world.</p>

<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson10">
  <h2>Plato's Epistemology: Deduction, Recollection and Mystical Insight</h2>
  <p>One main purpose of Plato's Philosophy was to answer the Sophists - to show that objective knowledge is possible.</p>
  <p>we must have been in contact with the world of Forms <i>prior</i> to this life</p>
  <p>But, when it was immersed in the body, the soul forgot all the things that it knew - but it's still there.</p>
  <p>"Acquiring" knowledge is actually remembrence (anamnesis), getting knowledge from the subconscious to the conscious.</p>
  <p>The senses are not a means of getting <i>new</i> knowledge. We need senses in the early stages of knowledge to serve as a stimulus.</p>
  <h4>The general arguments for innate ideas:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>We have a certain type of knowledge that we could <i>not</i> have acquired from sensory observation</li>
    <li>But we have it</li>
    <li>Therefore, it must have been acquired afrom some means apart from the senses</li>
    <li>We must be born with it - it must be innate</li>

  <p>Virtue = excellent performance of function</p>
  <p>Pleasure is not happiness (eudaimonia)</p>
  <p><i>No man can really be harmed by anybody else</i> because the crucial determinant of his soul is up to him; nobody can make you unhappy in this fundamental sense. Conversely, they can also not <i>give</i> you happiness.</p>
  <p>Virtue requires knowledge</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Knowledge is a <i>necessary</i> condition of virtue.</li>
    <li>Knowledge is a sufficient condition of virtue - How does virtue guarantees virtue? Everyone necessarily pursues that which je thinks will lead to his own welfare. Everyone who knows what virtue is and sees that it leads to his welfare
      will
      necessarily pursue it. Therefore, everyone who doesn't live the good lige does not know the nature and the rewards of virtue.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The second has a negative effect: It wipes out the distinction between errors of knowledge and breaches of morality. There is no volitional immoral behaviour.</p>
  <p>It assumes that all men are rational egoists, which is demonstrably false. To become a rational egoist is an achievement, not an innate endowment.</p>
  <h4>Essential to free will is that you have to summon your knowledge and concentrate on it in any givern situation by consistent acts of focusing.</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Man has a nature</li>
    <li>happiness depende on iving in accordance with your natre</li>
    <li>Sophistic whim-worshipping is the means to guaranteed misery</li>
    <li>Knowledge of man's nature and requirements is indispensable to virtue and happiness.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Plato's psychology (the nature of the soul and the nature of man)</h3>
  <p>Man is a creature who has ties to <i>both</i> worlds.</p>
  <p>Man's higher nature is his reason, his mind, the part that studies the Forms and acquires knowledge</p>
  <p>His lower nature is the irrational element in him - feelings and emotions for things in this world.</p>
  <p>These 2 are fundamentally <i>independent</i> and <i>opposed</i> components making up the essence of the soul</p>
  <h4>The Argument from conflict</h4>
  <p>If a man is urged in 2 opposite directions at the same time, there must be two opposite parts at work, 2 independent motivating sources, one pushing one way, and one the other.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The lowest part he calls the <i>appetites</i> - the desires for physical things</li>
    <li>The higher part of the lower part, the <i>spirited</i> element - passionate, more violent part of your emotional life</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Inside the skin of every man there are 3 creatures: little man(reason), lion (the spirited element), and a many-headed, slobbering beast (the appetites)</p>
  <h4>For Plato there is a tripartite soul - 3 autonomous sources of behaviour, so that man is inherently in conflict</h4>
  <p>The greeks' 4 cardinal vurtues: wisdom, courage, temperance and justice.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The spirited element is the part that incites you to action. Its proper function is to let itself be guided by reason. If so, man will have the virtue of courage.</li>
    <li>The appetititive lement performs the life-promoting functions - concern for food, sex, sustenance, physical goods. This is the most dangerous lement - we must never indulge in appetites as ends in themselves. If you do this, you have
      temperance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If all parts work well and do not interfere with another, then the man has justice.</p>
  <p>If you live the way the Sophists say you will kill yourself spiritually.</p>
  <h3>Platonic views:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>A certain type of determinism. You are helpless to change your character.</li>
    <li>Since the passions in general are bad, and all men necessarily feel them, there is an Achile's heel in human nature, and the ground is prepared for the Original Sin.</li>
    <li>Emotions are basical antithetical to reason, and they demand some expression, and therefore a completely rational man would have to be a man without emotions.</li>
    <li>The grading of careers depending upon which part of the soul is most involved. Businessmen, industrialists, producers come out as very low types, as against philosophers, or "pure" scientists.</li>
    <li>The idea that the love of money is the root of all evil.</li>
    <li>The Platonic view of sex. How should true love operate? An individual's body, then soul, then the beauty of both, then the beauty of art, scientific discoveries, laws, etc., adn then you love the Form of beauty. Platonic love is the Form
      of
      Beauty/ Form of the Good</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Plato’s Political Philosophy: Collectivism and the Philosopher-King</h2>
  <h3>Plato's Politics</h3>
  <h4>Three Classes of Men</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>men in whom <i>reason</i> is dominant: <i>Philosophers</i></li>
    <li>Men in whom the <i>spirited</i> element is dominant: <i>Soldiers</i></li>
    <li>Men in whom the <i>appetites</i> are most developed: <i>the Masses</i></li>
  </ol>
  <h4>The Myth of the Metals</h4>
  <p>Philosophers have gold in their souls, the soldiers have silver, the masses ave brass. Innately determined by the kind of spiritual metal they have in their soul.</p>
  <h4>Who should rule?</h4>
  <p>The Philosophers - tey are the only men of reason, the only ones who know the Form of the Good, who know what's right and how to act.</p>
  <p>Just as reason has to rule in the soul, so the men of reason have to rule in the state. Just as reason must have unlimited power in the soul, philosophers must have unlimited power in the state.</p>
  <h4>Why not let each man rule his <i>own</i> life by his own reason?</h4>
  <p>Because it is impossible for most men to live their own lives rationally. They are in the cave.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>This world is unreal; true knowledge is otherwordly.</li>
    <li>Most men are this wordly - they're incapable of a mystic vision.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Most men are incurably irrational, incapable to rule themselves. Therefore, we need rule by an authoritarian few who have specilized knowledge.</p>
  <p>Mysticism leads to dictatorship. Irrationalism leads to statism.</p>
  <h4>Three-class society</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>The philosophers: the state has the virtue of <i>wisdom</i> when they are in charge - legislature</li>
    <li>The Military: when they have properly performed their functions, the state has <i>courage</i> - executive</li>
    <li>The Masses: their primary virtue is <i>temperance</i>, which in this context means obedience - economic class</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This is not a caste society.</p>
  <h4>Will Philosophers abuse their power?</h4>
  <p> They know the good, they have lost interest in everything that could tempt them - remove all their property to make sure</p>
  <p>Individuality is not real. All that is real are universals. What is real about men is what the thing they are all the same in - manness</p>
  <h4>What is your political obligation according to Plato?</h4>
  <p>Live for the welfare of the state, recognize your position in society.</p>
  <p>Education must be thoroughly controlled by the state, we must have thorough censorship.</p>

<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson13">
  <h2>Aristotle: A Philosopher for Living on Earth</h2>
  <p>Aristotelianism is philosophy as a rational science versus philosophy as a rationalization for subjective whims or mystic trances.</p>
  <h3>Aristotle (384 - 322 BC)</h3>
  <p>He studied under Plato for ~20 years. He was a Platonist.</p>
  <p>He came to question and reject Plato's views, developing his own philosophy.</p>
  <p>He opened The Lyceum, his own university.</p>
  <p><strong>"The parapatetic philosopher"</strong></p>
  <h3>Metaphysics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>There is one reality, <i>this reality</i> - the world we live in</li>
    <li>Reality is objective, it's absolute, it is what it is independent of Consciousness</li>
    <li>There is only this reality and no supernatural world.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>He wrote polemics against the world of Forms</p>
  <p>We can separate the common characteristics running through a group of particulars as a <i>mental</i> process, as a process of <i>thought</i></p>
  <p>This does not mean that this common denominator can exist in reality <i>apart</i> from its particular accompaniments. It is simply an abstraction - a result of selective awareness on our part.</p>
  <p>Plato believed that because we can separate 2 things in thought, they can exist separatley in reality.</p>
  <p>This is, says Aristotle, the fallacy of reification ("think-making"); he makes a thing out of what is simply an abstraction.</p>
  <h4>Only particular, individual, concrete things exist in reality.</h4>
  <p>Universals are distinguishable from particulars, universals are real.</p>
  <h4>Universals are real, but they exist only in particulars.</h4>
  <p>Each thing that exists is a metaphysical compound comprised of 2 elements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Everything is an individual, particular concretel it is what Aristotle calls a "this"; it has something unique about it.</li>
    <li>It has a certain <i>nature</i>; certain characteristics it shares with other things on the basis of which we can classify it; it is not only a "this", it is a "such", a certain <i>kind</i> of thing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Everything is a "this-such", a particular of a certain kind, an individual which belongs to a certain class.</p>
  <p>For the universal element, he uses the word "form". For the particular, individuating element, he use the term "matter".</p>
  <p>"Matter" stands for those aspects of a thing which make it unique; "form", those aspects of a thing it share with other things.</p>
  <h4>You never can have matter without form, nor matter without form.</h4>
  <p>Aristotle's view is called "Aristotelian realism" - <i>Universals</i> are real, but they only exist in <i>particulars</i>.</p>
  <p>The fundamental constituent of reality is the entity - the individual thing.</p>
  <p>Aristotle is the true author of the principle of the <i>primacy of existence</i>, as against the principle of the <i>primacy of consciousness</i>.</p>
  <h4>Primacy of existence</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Reality is what it is independent of the content or actions of any consciousness</li>
    <li>reality is the irreducible primary which sets the terms for consciousness</li>
    <li>Consciousness is simply the faculty for perceiving the facts of reality</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Primacy of consciousness:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Consciousness in some form comes first it sets the terms for reality, and reality is somehow an offshoot or derrivative or byproduct of the activities or content of consciousness.</li>
    <li>facts are not what they are, but rather whatever the ruling consciousness chooses them to be</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The question is "What as a matter of fact IS reality?", then "What processes of knowledge are suitable for acquiring knowledge of such a reality?".</p>
  <p>Aristotle was the first who first discovered the primacy of reality.</p>
  <p>He refuses to endorse any dichotomy between reality and appearance. reality is what we observe, and any theories which go counter to it are simply wrong.</p>
  <p>Logic = "organon", metaphysics = "first philosophy"</p>

<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson14">
  <h2>Aristotle’s Epistemology: Concepts, Explanation and the Nature of Science</h2>
  <h3>What do we begin with in terms of knowledge? Aristotle: Nothing</h3>
  <p>We are born <i>tabula rasa</i></p>
  <p>All knowldge starts with sense experience.</p>
  <p>This view is called <i>empiricism</i> - all knowledge is derived from the evidence of the sense. Since Hume, empiricism = subjectivism/skepticism (knowledge comes ONLY by the senses)</p>
  <p>The senses are the beginning of knowledge. COncepts can be grasped by a process of abstraction from particulars without antecedent knowledge.</p>
  <p>The process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You start with sense experience.</li>
    <li>You remember past sense experiences - i.e., you retain your percepts</li>
    <li>After a number of similar percepts are repeated, you can detect common denominators among them and abstract, and concentrate selectively on the common denominators, ignoring the differences.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>On Plato's Argument of Perfection: Abstract away from the imperfection.</p>
  <p>The goal of knowledge is to understand, to find out why things happen - to see their <i>necessity</i>. To get to the <i>that</i> and the <i>why</i>, the facts and the causes.</p>
  <p>What a thing bascially and essentially <i>is</i> determines its characteristics and its behavior. And to explain any particular thing, therefore, we must know to what <i>class</i> does it belong; what are its <i>essential
      characteristics</i>?
  </p>
  <h4>Aristotle's definition of a "definition" is "the statement of a class" - i.e., the statement of those fundamental characteristics which make the class what it is and differentiate it from all other types of thing. How do you arrive at
    correct
    definitions?</h4>
  <p>All definitions must have a certain structure; they consist of 2 parts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The general kind of thing something is - the wider, general class - known as the <i>genus</i></li>
    <li>A further element specifying how the thing differs from everything else within the genus - called the <i>differentia</i></li>
  </ol>
  <p>If you have these 2 and you have chosen them correctly, you must have reached the essence of the class.</p>
  <p>Rule 1: Your definition must be commensurate with the class you are defining - i.e., it must be true only of members of the class and of <i>all</i> of those members. You can go wrong it 2 ways on this rule: either your definition might be
    too
    <i>wide</i> or too <i>narrow</i>, take in too much territory or not enough.</p>
  <p>Rule 2: The definition must state the <i>fundamental</i> characteristics of the class to be defined</p>
  <p>We must make a firm distinction between the <i>essence</i> and the <i>derivative</i> characteristics (Aristotle called them "properties"), they are not fundamental, they are results or effects of the essence of the class.</p>
  <p>What we do when we try to understand a fact is learn the connection between the essence of things and their properties.</p>
  <h4>Aristotle's theory of explanation: <i>Explanation consists in seeing the particular events that we observe as instances of a general principle which relates the nature of some class to its mode of action.</i></h4>
  <p>You don't observe general principles; all we observe is particulars. There must be a process of acquiring the knowledge of the general principle by observing the particular facts, and this process he calls <i>induction</i>(epagoge) - "the
    process of passing in thought from particulars to a general principle"</p>
  <p>Induction is a fundamental procedure of human knowledge, because it is the ultimate <i>source</i> of all of our general principles.</p>
  <p>He had a primitive concept of induction - induction by enumeration. He had no control experimentation. </p>
  <p>The best you could get by induction was the <i>suggestion</i> of alaw, which you then had to validate by some other means.</p>
  <p>Now we can now apply the laws we've learned to new particulars.</p>
  <p>The process of starting with the general principle and applying it to a particular case is, of course, <strong><i>deduction</i></strong>.</p>
  <p>Induction gives you the basic general laws; deduction uses these laws to explain and understand particular instances.</p>

<div class="tab" data-tab="lesson15">
  <h2>Aristotle: The Father of Logic</h2>
  <h3>Logic, Axioms & Science</h3>
  <p>What do we actually do when we defend a conclusion by stating the premises?</p>
  <h4>
    <ul>
      <li>All men are mortal</li>
      <li>Socrates is a man</li>
      <li>Socrates is mortal</li>
    </ul>
  </h4>
  <p>Every argument will have three terms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The subject of the conclusion: <i>the minor term</i></li>
    <li>The predicate of the conclusion: <i>the major term</i></li>
    <li>The linking term, which occurs in each premise, but not in the conclusion: <i>the middle term</i></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is called a syllogism</p>
  <h3>"A syllogism is a deductive argument with two premises. It contains only three terms, two of ehich are linked in the conclusion as a result of the linking of each of them with the third or middle term in the premises."</h3>
  <p><i>Aristotle formalized & systematized the rules of reasoning</i></p>
  <p>he defined for the first time what it means to prove sometihng - to prove it or explain it - objectively.</p>
  <p>There must be basic self-evident truths (archai). These are the foundation of human knowledge. Of these, it is improper to ask for <i>proof</i> because they are the ultimate foundation of everything else.</p>
  <p>"To demand a proof of everything argues want of education" - Aristotle</p>
  <p>Aristotle distinguishes 2 geenral types of axioms</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Those at the base of just one science or one branch of knowledge</li>
    <li>Universal axioms - axioms which you have to know to know anything (e.g. laws of logic)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each science has special axioms unique to it. The ultimate goal is to find these first principles.</p>
  <p>Differences from Plato's divided line:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The basic definitions are abstracted ultimately from sense experience and must be objectively defined; there is no mystical Goodness at the end.</li>
    <li>There is no <i>one</i> ultimate principle from which every subject is deducible</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is how Aristotle carved out the odea of a <i>specific</i> science.</p>
  <h3>The laws of logic</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <i>law of contradiction</i> - nothing can be A and non-A at the same time and the same respect</li>
    <li>The <i>law of excluded middle</i> - nothing can be A or non-A ar a given time and in a given respect</li>
    <li>The law of identity - A is A</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The laws of logic are laws of all reality - they are laws of being <strong><i>qua</i></strong> being</p>
  <p>The only way we can arrive at them is by direct abstraction from self-evident sensory facts.</p>
  <p>The faculty which grasps the self-evident is given the forbidding and misleading name "intuitive <i>nous</i>". <i>Nous</i> is the Greek word for "mind"</p>
  <p>"Intuitive nous" simply means the human mind in its capacity to ggrasp self-evident principles, as opposed to the deductive or reasoning nous which draws conclusions from these principles</p>
  <h4>If the laws of logic are truly the foundation of all human thought, then we should be able to demonstrate that even the <i>objector</i> has to rely upon them - "reaffirmation through denial"</h4>
  <p>Aristotle was the first to give a formal definition of "truth" that is valid</p>
  <p>"To say of that which is, that it is,or of that which is not that it is not, is true. To say of that which is that it is not, or of that which is not that it is, is false."</p>
  <p>Aristotle was the first to organize and feine, in a systematic way, a great many common and widespread fallacies of reasoning.</p>
